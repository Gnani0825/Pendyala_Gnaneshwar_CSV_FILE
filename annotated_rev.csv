iquine,"I bet you'd never think the mash-up the heavy-handed Rambo with the mystical stunning elegance of Crouching Tiger would work especially, while mixing in several musical numbers. Those who think that would be wrong. This movie was over the top in every way but it was pure awesomeness. Even with a 3-hour runtime, I was engrossed. It was a great story with thorough character development. A young native girl is effectively purchased by the mean British government who is controlling the people of Malli, presumably in India. This small tribe from which she belongs has a talented fighter who will stop at absolutely nothing to get her back. But the British government also has an Indian soldier who is equally as skilled; both of which dwarf all other soldiers as you'll see in the spectacular opening scene. As the two skilled fighters clash, will they come together for their heritage roots or will the duty of the one hold true to the army he works for. This movie blew me away. I've never seen special effects quite like this before. There were a plethora of frames that could be used for sweet posters. This movie was produced with smart editing, cinematography and choreography. This is a modern must see.",9/10,positive
JeanDeMichaque,"When I pushed play, I did not really believe that I would ever watch the whole movie. I just wanted to take a look and bail on it.Well, I was so wrong. This movie is a freaken masterpiece, combines some extraordinary drama, stunning stunts and action, great photography and absolutely beautiful music. Given that this is a Bollywood movie, you know that you are going to watch some pretty ridiculous action scenes, an overall cheesy direction and dialogues and that the acting won't exactly be Oscar worthy. But none of it made me not enjoy this movie. The time passed by very easily and I ended up having a really great time.The eye candy that is Ram Charan made this movie even more watch worthy in particular. That is one ridiculously handsome man, I have to say ;P.",9/10,positive
Jeremy_Urquhart,"I have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly, because it's not really comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently. But I can say that for large-scale, big-budget action movies, this is how you do it right. Hollywood isn't incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion, but many pale in comparison to RRR. Again without pointing out any movies in particular (because I don't know what's directly comparable), Hollywood should take notes.RRR has many familiar tropes and beats that you get out of historical epics/action movies, but it uses those tropes well. Things we've seen on-screen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if they're used properly, and RRR is a testament to that.The amazing action is probably what stands out the most, but at its core, this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated. There's some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie, but ultimately it's a good vs evil story that's pretty straightforward and honest about that, and thanks to the great characters and strong performances, that ends up being enough.There's very little by way of slow scenes or dead air, and another reason the three hour runtime flies by is because the action is so good. I complain about lacklustre action in modern action movies a lot, and so I was really happy to find that RRR does its action so well. Amazing stunts, great setups for the big set piece scenes, a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat (but not too much that it feels gratuitous), and a way of making things over-the-top in the best way possible (so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys). The two main heroes in this are almost superheroes, which arguably makes RRR the best superhero film in years.Excellent stuff. A couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky English dialogue from the British characters is all I could criticise it for, and they're nitpicks. This is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three hour runtime.",9/10,positive
evanston_dad,"I have seen a lot of movies in my time, made in a lot of different styles from different genres, from all around the world. I've seen everything from the most mainstream movie imaginable to the most experimental. I can't even remember the last time I came away from a movie thinking that I'd never seen anything like it. But that's how I felt after ""RRR.""This movie is so much. Its ""much""-ness may be a turn off to some, and almost was for me. My wife and I nearly bailed at the 20 minute mark because the film is so over the top and ridiculous. But we got hooked, and then I was totally in for the ride, to the point where I was disappointed that this 3+-hour behemoth was ending.Do you like to see muscle-bound, slicked-up men fighting tigers? Check. How about public floggings that turn into musical numbers? Got it. Evil British people so extremely evil that England should sue the filmmakers for defamation? Sure. How about evil British people being mauled by rampaging jungle animals? You betcha. Beheadings? Yep. Romance? Of course. Homoeroticism so intense just watching this movie may turn you gay? Hoo-boy. Let's just say that anything not already in this movie isn't worth having anyway.Watch ""RRR,"" and then make sure whatever the first movie is that you watch after it is one you don't care too much about, because it will most certainly feel like the palest imitation of a movie you have ever seen. Seriously, this movie is so deliriously bonkers and so unafraid to be absolutely absurd that it's almost impossible to watch pretty much any other movie now and not be disappointed by it for not being this one. Thanks a lot ""RRR.""Grade: A+",10/10,negative
owenpont-70803,"This was an incredible film. I never heard of this film until Netflix brought it up. I saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it. I am glad I did, the dancing scene at the party was incredible. Arguably the scene was the best scene in the film. But also the first scene where Ram Charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well. Overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action, comedy, romance, dancing and great storytelling.",10/10,positive
matthewssilverhammer,"There is officially ZERO reason to watch Gray Man; THIS is the only (not-so-)semi-subtle homoerotic Netflix action epic we need. A tightrope walk between complete silliness & beautiful sincerity, it has entertainment value dripping from every colorful pore: insane action, enveloping dialogue, sprawling yet intimate storytelling, elaborate dancing (yep!). Admittedly, the unfamiliarity of the tone may be a bit much for those prepared, but it's hard to deny the bravura movie-making, daring you to not to have fun.",10/10,negative
Dark_Lord_Mark,"SO long story short, word of mouth happened and more and more people including myself heard about this movie and here we are.It's about friendship and honor and wants and well everything Star Wars Prequels should have been. It's everything Marvel should have been.This movie is about 2 men, super human, some suspension of belief needs to be had. View it as a super hero movie and it delivers.Plot: It's about 2 men; a hero and the anti hero. One has duty, one has family.It's an action movie, think what Avengers Civil War, Batman vs Superman should have been. In modern American movies, the overuse of CGI makes the movies look cheap. RRR has CGI and some places it does look a little cheap, but for a modern big budget film, it delivers.I have to give it between a 9 and 10. My expectations were low, but the AMAZING actions scenes were filmed very well, the acting and just the over the top hero moments were well done.Highly recommended and a must see.",10/10,positive
nelson-akash,"An Average Film made on Rs. 600 crores Budget...Big on Visuals but Weak on Emotions !!! One time watch... Nothing to take back Home. Have been Missing Story Tellers like Maniratnam Sir.

But then I must say one thing Hats of to Create such a Grand Cinematic Experience.

cs_rahul_prasad,"The last time director SS Rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film Baahubali: The Conclusion. It took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film RRR, shoot and bring it to the silver screen. Pulling off a multi-starrer with Jr NTR and Ram Charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself. But Rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the story.RRR is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries - Alluri Seetharama Raju who waged an armed campaign against the British and Komaram Bheem a tribal from the Gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people. There is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but Rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meeting.RRR runs on a relatively simple premise. There's 'fire' - an angry, young police officer Ramaraju (Ram Charan) who is both revered and feared by the British. He has done their every bidding for years, he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet, he is the one who's never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin. Then there's 'water' - sweet, simple, innocent Bheem (Jr NTR) who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose. He's a Gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called Malli, who was taken away by Lady Scott (Alison Doody), to be the singing doll 'on (her) mantelpiece'. But that is just the beginning of the tale.Rajamouli's new calling cards seem to be building new world. Because, despite being based on two revolutionaries from history, RRR has a story that's completely fictional. Delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas. Bheem might have fought against the Nizams, so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the British that he's not to be taken lightly. But he also finds shelter with Muslims in Delhi. Ramaraju might seem like a well-trained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle (Samuthirakani) knows about. Scott (Ray Stevenson) might believe 'brown rubbish' deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but Jennifer (Olivia Morris) seems more empathetic. This is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek, this is the one where you use your hands as weapons.The first half of RRR runs like clockwork. There's the emotional core in Malli, there's the song and dance with Naatu Naatu (it'll make you smile) and a friendship explored through Dosti, there's even a few laughs whenever Bheem tries to befriend Jennifer. Cinematic liberties are taken but they don't seem as noticable as in the later portions, half where the film falters a bit. The way Ramaraju's fiancé Sita (Alia Bhatt) is woven into the narrative, apart from Ram Charan's transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing. After the way Bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told, the way Ramaraju's story unfolds seems strained. The climax leaves more to be desired. The good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you. Rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverly.None-the-less Rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for - a commercial, action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained - which it does. The length also doesn't prove to be a hindrance, thanks to a tight screenplay. The VFX in certain portions could've been better. Jr NTR pulls off his career's best performance. He's charming as Bheem, especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find Malli comes through well, so does his love for Ramaraju. Ram Charan also does well, pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through. Tarak and Charan's roles require them to have chemistry, which they do. Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris, Samuthirakani, Ajay Devgn, Shriya Saran and others play their parts well. Olivia in particular manages to win your heart. Alison and Ray breeze through their roles. Keeravani's OST for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the BGM. Senthil's camerawork is a delight too.RRR is made for a big screen viewing. The cinematography and visual aesthetics paint every frame in a radiating manner. Oodles of flamboyance is something one has come to expect from Rajamouli now. The background score thuds with relentless urgency and repetition, unapologetically melodramatic and quite smitten with itself. It numbs us into submission but post-interval as the pace falters a little, the pleasures dwindle too.RRR is perfection by any means because after the way Rajamouli pulls off certain scenes, you wonder if he could've done a better job in others. But watch this one this weekend if you've been longing for a good action packed drama. Especially so if you're a fan of the lead duo.",10/10,positive
alphadude007,"RRR is an entertaining movie and is not a boring watch by any means. Rajamouli brings his usual grandeur to the movie and it is a spectacle. However, the storyline is super weak. Jr NTR's connection with the kidnapped girl is never established in the movie as a strong motive to bring down the empire. Ram's motive to kill and flay dozens of countrymen to fight against the British to get a stash of guns also is super bizzare. Lots of sequences in the movie also doesn't make sense, like Jr NTR spending months in the jungle to catch wild animals, transport them to the city, feed them for months and then unleash them on the British army? PLEASE! That was so funny. Then the main characters miraculously recovering from grave bodily blows in seconds and then doing full costume changes in a flicker? I mean, c'mon Rajamouli. Bahubali was epic cos it had a strong story to support the visuals. Here, the visuals are mediocre, story is piss poor and some of the scenes are cringe. The actors have done well though. Good chemistry and required machismo. Especially Ram Charan. Hopefully, we get such funds/resources to directors who can back up the visuals with an effective story.",6/10,positive
nathandm-75297,"RRR is one of the most critically acclaimed films of this year. It's been widely celebrated by both audiences and critics alike and is one of the most internationally successful Tollywood films of all time. My question is why?I'm not familiar at all with Tollywood/Bollywood movies. This was the first one I've seen all the way through. But prior to watching RRR, I was familiar with all of the Bollywood clichés and have seen numerous infamous clips on YouTube. They're all very over the top with their presentation and acting, they're all very long, and they all include several dance/musical numbers. But I figured since this was the first Tollywood movie to get this kind of recognition in the states that there was something different about this movie, something that stood out and there really isn't.As I was watching RRR I thought to myself, what if this was an American film and it featured the same story, the same action scenes, and the same length? I would think that this movie would be absolutely leveled by critics and audiences for being too bloated, too tonally inconsistent, having bad CGI effects, terrible pacing, underdeveloped romantic subplots, and one-dimensional villains. But I guess since this is a Tollywood movie all of those notable flaws are just fine? Do they add to the charm of this film? I don't know but I'm honestly low-key baffled by the reception that RRR is getting.And I'm also baffled by how this Tollywood film looks just like every other Indian action film that has come out for the past several years. Seriously what makes this movie so special in comparison to other Indian blockbusters?Here are a few positives I can give this film. There is some nice direction and cinematography, both of the lead actors have good chemistry, some of the action scenes are fun (some are also completely stupid) and sometimes the score is good (and sometimes it's not and very random). Clearly, Indian blockbuster films are just not for me, I'll acknowledge that. Cinema is subjective, so to the people who genuinely love this movie, I'm happy for you, but I still firmly stand by all of my criticisms for this movie and I still think it's easily the most overrated film to come out this year, by a lot.",5/10,positive
Xstal,"It strikes me that in recent times not many films coming out of traditional western studios can lay claim to being spectacular and yet, whenever I venture to the studios of India, and its array of languages, innovations and stories, the riches to be gorged upon are seldom short of extensive - and quite often spectacular. This is one such film, a jaw dropping piece of good old patriotic prowess that rips through three hours and leaves you desperate for three more. Read the reviews of others if you want to know the story, but take it from me, if overwhelming entertainment and spectacle in the grandest of ways is what sets you on fire, this is for you. On a par with anything you may have come across in the past, and sure to be replayed many times over once it gets its hooks into you, which it surely will - irresistible.",8/10,positive
Quinoa1984,"Total militaristic propaganda on a scale that is as immense in scope as a David Lean and as bloody and brutalist as Mel Gibson. It's certainly nowhere near as subtle as the former (well, duh, kids), but it also manages to be rapturously stupid it's gruesome violence than anything the latter would do. My wife with me also pointed out Zack Snyder but far superior visa vi ""here's a man with something to say... and it's LOUD and SLOW MO"" and I concur up to a point. And if you don't like British people, boys and girls have I got a smorgasbord of ""f the Brits"" for you (it's alright there's the one good lady one).But what experiencing all 187 minutes of RRR truly is - and final peppy and totally dissonant music number included that is the run time - is going to the All You Can eat buffet where you are not going to leave for like 10 hours: it's a somber and powerful war movie, a Gritty Run they the Jungle slaughter fest, a Cornball treatise on Friendship, a (at times very literally) fiery call to arms against the British or any Colonial power, a sliver of romance for good measure for Bheem, and for five to ten minutes a deliriously exciting Step Up dance-off movie. It's exhausting and crude and at times laughable (all those CGI animals oh my), and I had an absolute blast. You know what you're in for when our two heroes first meet under the bridge surrounded by fire. If you're not with it by then, leave and don't come back.I know this is not historically accurate (LOL), but who needs accuracy when the exploitation-meter needs breaks through the glass and becomes a superhero bent on saving everyone with all the guns? This is gloriously crazy but it's totally sincere. Oh, and Ray Stevenson: performance of his career! (If only Aamir Khan was here, 5 stars easy).",9/10,positive

HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMovie starts with two hero introductions, that itself like full meals satisfaction...Really the trailer shown the 30% of the movie, it has much more action blocks and goosebumps moments in the movie... its real double treat. Mass moments also doubled with dual heroes... Naattu song is the cherry on top, whole theatre goes mad on this one... the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one, even though we can guess this one, but cant guess the scale...Second half starts with bit slow flashback, but it picks up to the peak immediately. Second half has more sentiments and more screen space for RC. RC outshines NTR in lot of places... All the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable.... After credit Janta song has cameo from Rajamouli. When the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebration....Exceeding expectations in all aspects....",10/10,positive
bradclayton,"RRR's strengths are easily worth suspending a little disbelief (though no more than the average blockbuster) and accepting the style of acting. If you can get past that, and if the violence isn't too much for you, you're in for a treat.There is so much more heart in this movie than anything I've seen for a long while. It's nice to see a movie employ slow motion to convey emotion rather than try to magnify action. But more than the great camera work and fantastic music (this movie sounds tremendous), RRR knows how to setup a story. From the very beginning, screentime is being used to setup payoffs later.I can see the violence being an issue for some (though, RRR is not nearly as gory as many films, but it can feel brutal at times--enough that I can't really call this a family film).One of the best films I've seen. Excellent.",9/10,positive
SAMTHEBESTEST,"RRR (2022) :
Movie Review -High and Low. No, I'm not talking about Akira Kurosawa's Japanese flick from 1963, but I'm talking about SS Rajamouli's RRR. Actually, that's the best brief for the film I can think of. SS Rajamouli has been making mass-friendly commercial films for a long time, but Bahubali brought him pan-India popularity. He became a household name and a BRAND! So naturally, anything he would do after Bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too. The same happened with Prabhas when he came after Bahubali with ""Saaho"" and ""Radhe Shyam"". Let's just accept the fact that a film like ""Bahubali : The Conclusion"" (2017) can't be made again and again. Not just because it was a Massive Blockbuster, but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays. When I saw Bahubali 2, I called it the Greatest Commercial Entertainer of this millennium after Gadar (2001). Surprisingly, these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore+ tickets in the Hindi belt. It was acceptable to see such heroic characters in Bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period, which makes it reasonable. But with RRR, it can't be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century, where you expect some humanly possible stuff. It doesn't matter how big (fictionally) your character is, it has to make some sense when it comes to on-screen persona, as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period, who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood, and it all came with human restrictions. RRR looks problematic in that sense, but if you talk about mass cinema, then RRR is simply phenomenal.RRR is a fictional tale set in the 1920s. Two Indian revolutionaries, Rama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Jr. NTR), try to fight the mighty British Empire and Nizam of Hyderabad in their own ways, which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other. Bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by British officer Steve (Ray Stevenson) and his wife, Lady Scott (Alison Doody), while Rama is a British cop who tries to stop him. Two powerful heroes, one fiRe and one wateR, are pitted against each other, and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past events.RRR presents Ram Charan and Jr. NTR in never-seen-before avatars. Rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls. Ram Charan enters with a 5-minute long action scene, which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind, but that's what ""mass cinema"" means, right? On the other hand, Jr. NTR has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too. That entire forest sequence will blow your mind. A good happy warning to all Tarak fans: please keep your expectations high because Bheem is going to exceed all of them. The pair of Rama and Bheem work like a fireworks display during all those large-scale action sequences. Talking about the supporting cast, especially two Hindi actors, Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt, both have small but important cameos. Ajay Devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again, and in other news, the sky is blue. This man has some charisma of his own. It's only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly. Alia Bhatt as Sita looks gorgeous in every single scene, and her character plays a vital part in the narrative. Olivia Morris sparkles the screen with her beauty, and her accent is too cute. Alison Doody is the exact opposite of that, but that's what the villainous characters do. Both Samuthirakani and Shriya Saran appear in small roles, and both pass with good grades.RRR's basic script is as good as any Telugu action drama (mind you, some call it mindless), but the screenplay doesn't match that certain level you are expecting. The second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too. All those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the Big-screen extravaganza in 3D. The action sequences of RRR have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in India. Rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done Bahubali. That film still had battlefield references to help a bit, but RRR, despite being driven by two characters, provides a better visual spectacle than Bahubali. That's not a small thing, mind you. The music of RRR is going to create some hysteria in theatres. If you don't feel like dancing while ""Naacho Naacho,"" I'd say please consult a doctor. You are not normal. ""Dosti"" has got nice tunes for a situational song, and ""Komuram Bheemudo"" will take you all by surprise. I'm not sure if you can hear ""Raamam Raaghavam"" clearly because there will be a lot of noise, including big screams and whistles, going around at the time. But you'll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching home.It's been more than two years since we haven't had a big pan-India event film and SS Rajamouli brings back that much needed ""Big-Screen Experience"" for us. Undoubtedly, the best director in India when it comes to commercial cinema. The name is SS Rajamouli! His extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in India. Bahubali was an ordinary script, but it's Rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film. No matter how many resemblances you find between it and ""The Lion King"" or its original source material, Shakespeare's Hamlet, it's a story every Indian can relate to. That's the same case with RRR, despite some flaws in the writing. But that's where Rajamouli's genius mind works overtime. He presents the high-octane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy. The hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too. Whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that pre-interval rampage or even that mind-boggling climax in the forest, SS Rajamouli has outdone himself. He has reached a level that other commercial directors in Indian cinema can never reach or even dream about. Give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it. That's what he has done with RRR. Every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas. Every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him. As a whole, RRR packs a solid punch of out-and-out commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the Bahubali juggernaut. Just don't mind the below average writing, and you are going to LOVE IT!RATING - 6/10*",6/10,positive
Sleepin_Dragon,"Don't ask me for a plot, because I didn't have a clue what was happening, all I know is that I absolutely loved what I just watched.I'll admit I was captivated The other day when I watched Jai Bhim, so I decided I'd opt for another Indian movie, RRR was suggested, wow, all I can say is wow.This is one of the most spectacularly outrageous films I think I've ever seen, I loved it. As wild and over the top as you can imagine, all I'd say is please stick with it, I know it's a long film, but it's just so incredibly entertaining. I'm not sure anyone's going to convince me that anything here is based on real life events, but boy does it hold your attention.This film is violent, dramatic, shocking when funny, you honestly don't know what on Earth is going to come next.The visuals are quite sensational, it is one of the most visually decadent things I have ever seen. The tiger and wolf scene, that was mind blowing, talk about getting the pulse racing.Wow, those evil English people (even if they did have accents that were closer to Kentucky than Kent,) are really evil, they even make the British villains on Murder, she wrote seem subtle.Outrageous. 9/10.",9/10,negative
justahunch-70549,"There is no doubt that I am out of touch with most of the other reviewers here as well as critics as indicated by my falling asleep after the first hour. There is no questioning this film's technical achievements, which are many. The CGI could not be improved on as there is not a thing that does not look real in an action packed somewhat monotonous three plus hour film. This begins with a girl in India being kidnapped by a British governor due to the wishes of his horrid wife and because of that, hundreds, if not thousands, die. Throw all logic out the window with this one. Everything in this film is over-the-top. The action, the story, the characters, the violence, even the music. It is beautiful to look at, no doubt, but it is so ridiculously illogical it is sometimes just silly, though there are sequences that are pretty amazing to watch, but turn off your brain before viewing. The actors put a lot into this, especially the two leads, but their performances are just as larger than life as their characters are. Cecille B. DeMille would be envious.",6/10,negative

All the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the Olivia moris. Ajay Devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the Film.The best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effects.The action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excuted.The film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or another.one of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years.",10/10,positive

The movie has everything - spectacle, action, music, dancing and singing, drama - and the list goes on! The three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more. Hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the Indian Film Industry. Now a few questions... Why was this film not nominated for quite a number of Oscars? It should have been the Indian entry in the International Film category. What about other Oscar nominations - for cinematograpy, costuming, music score, film editing etc.? We have decided to search out more Indian films available to us. It must have been a wonderful experience to see RRR in a theatre on a large screen. We highly recommend this fabulous, exciting movie.",10/10,positive
andrewchristianjr,"The action scenes were just as badass. It's so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that I loved it. It's basically a superhero movie.

Sort of like watching Twillight, things make no sense, crazy, unfathomable action scenes, followed by out of place music numbers(which is par for the course).The worst part is that I can't comment on the movie while watching with her, which would give me enjoyment, just like I got enjoyment from Twillight and The Room by making fun and laughing at the movies.So, if your significant other is fine with you commenting or making fun of the movie, you will enjoy it tbh.

jace_the_film_guy,"This might be uncultured, but I usually struggle to watch films with are subtitled or dubbed. This film completely broke that precedent, as I loved every minute of it. The characters, the action, the dancing, the emotion, everything was larger than life, well-executed and mesmerizing.There were elements in this movie that I have never seen before and left me with my jaw on the floor. The film is three hours long, but every scene was necessary and added to the emotional depth of the story. The highlight of this film is the incredible chemistry and relationship between the two leads. The instant rapport and harmony between Ram and Bheem is inspiring, which makes some of the later moments so poignant.As a whole, RRR is over-the-top and big, but also subtle and real. In one moment I would be grinning ear to ear, in the next I was crying, and in the next I was gasping with excitement. Though there were elements I didn't fully understand, I can appreciate the breathtaking art of filmmaking and I am anxious to give it another watch.Note: If watching at home, I would recommend watching this film in two or three parts. An intermission is helpful.Note 2: The dancing scene is an all-timer!Note 3: If there is ever an opportunity for me to see this in theaters, I would jump on it in a second!",9/10,positive

When we watch bahubali 2 first time, It can't get over from my head for 1 week... Bahubali is a godlike hero and fantasy movie and every action he do looks really even you see it many times, But bheem and ram are just normal human beings, showing them as super humans looks very unrealistic. First half is boring, When bheem meet maari at scott home at jail there is no emotion than i can feel, it's look like they are acting, Slightly comedy in some scene, In last scene ram is injured his legs and next scene he is running and jumping, It's good to watch one time but when watch again you notice many things and that's making feel worse.",3/10,positive

oliviascotland-53336,"Okay, so I almost NEVER leave reviews for movies, but I just finished watching this on Netflix, and could not figure out how to leave a review there, other than to give it a 2-thumbs up (which I did wholeheartedly), but I enjoyed this movie to such a degree that I literally went looking for a site/any site online that would allow me to leave a review, and so here I am. First off, I know that very many people might be deterred by 1) the fact that this is a foreign Hindi film with subtitles (I get it; I'm not a fan of subtitles either), and 2) the fact that it was over 3 hours long. But all I can think now is what a tragedy it would be to miss out on all this goodness just because one is too lazy to read some subtitles or not inclined to sit for 3 hours to watch this masterpiece. I mean, seriously... think about it. We waste 3 hours doing nonsense -- walking somebody's mall, indulging in surfacey nonsense talk on our cellphones, watching mindless reality shows on t.v. If we can do any of that, we should most definitely be able to spend time absorbing this cinematic masterpiece. RRR has every single thing a human mind and soul yearns for -- an amazing story with plot twists and turns that leave you reeling and that keep you riveted. It has the kind of action that leaves you speechless. I saw some comments about the action being over-the-top, but who cares? I'm sure neither the director nor producers swore on a stack of bibles that they were telling a factual, historical tale, so give me over-the-top. For all the Negative Nancies and Negative Nathans going on about over-the-top action, do you say the same thing when Vin Diesel/Dom jumps off a 40-storied building in his 1970 Dodge Charger in Fast & Furious and lives to tell the tale? I didn't think so, and that's equally over-the-top, so shut the hell up. This film moved me in more ways than I can even begin to express, and unlike some of the reviewers who seem to want to tell the entire story in their review (spoilers and all; which I absolutely hate), I'll simply say that if you're up for a piece of cinematic magic and want to come alive watching a movie like you've probably never done before, then stream and hit PLAY! Enjoy!!!!!",10/10,positive
manirsoffl,"As a story, there is no such twist and turns and non linear activities like that. A straight and almost one line story with the two biggies made it easier. First half was very good even there was no such flaws of screenplay even the run time was almost more than 90 mins. The problem was the second half of the movie, which badly falls. In tha name of emotions they have poorly executed the screenplay which falls desperately. When it comes the vfx's(except animal effects) everything was visibly attractive. The fire and the water act for the actors worked very well in most of the aspects. The climax fight and the making was actually not satisfying when compared to the first half fight sequences. Overall a technicall strong with flaws in some vfx scenes and with the flawly writted second half, yes we can enjoy it once for the technical brilliance.",6/10,positive

li0904426,"The movie ""Rise, Roar, Revolt"" or ""RRR"" is an Indian period film directed by S. S. Rajamouli, spoken in Telugu, a language other than Hindi. The movie combines drama, musicals, thrillers, and action. The film is set in the 1920s pre-independent India and is based on the fictional lives of two freedom fighters. Against this background, the smart director Rajamouli takes the opportunity to show the prejudice, racism, and domineering colonialism of the British Government.The movie becomes repetitive and tiresome due to many scenes that could be edited out, and also two plots, one about Bheem's life and another about Raju's life. The movie is also full of special effects which makes it more dynamic and exciting but pure ""plastic"". The plot is predictable and nothing original. It's a mix of ""Rambo"" with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""",6/10,positive

Guj,"First off, this movie is goofy. Your typical Indian action blockbuster tollywood film, but goofy.This is a spectacle to say the least. The CGI is great in parts (the animals) and awful in others (car flips and stunts).When you're watching this movie, reality has to go out of the window but the problem with that is what you're left with is the unlikelihood of anything real happening, which in turn makes the relationships between the characters that much more fake and unbelievable, which means the actors have to overact to sell that fake-real friendship and the writing has to be that much more unbelievable. It all gets way too much and spans for way too long doing it.I can only guess that the majority of newly added 10* starred reviews are from people who hate the British (fair) or westerners who've never seen a tollywood/Telugu film before and just watched the Hindi-dub on Netflix (most likely) jumping on the bandwagon.For Tollywood fans and Tamil/Telugu speakers this movie is a great upgrade for what they're normally used to, but everyone else is hyping this film up to something it's not.",6/10,positive
aurigagraphicstudio,All I can say is that Rajamouli has delivered once again. Both the lead actors characterisation and chemistry between them is wonderfully crafted. There are ample high moments in the movie. The first shot where two heroes meet is on of the best in the movie. Great interval. Terrific first half. Second half has tons of emotional scenes which take you on an emotional roller coaster. All I can say is that it's a clear winner !!,10/10,positive
johnspringer-95440,"It's the revisionist history of pan-Indian nationalism vs. The British Raj in this overstuffed action epic. Some of the action is cool and the two leads have charisma to burn. But with a runtime over 3 hours the endless spectacle, the obvious character reversals and the goofy musical interludes become excessive.The story is uplifting. (At least it is if you can accept the British as disposable villains on par with Hollywood's typical depiction of certain 1930s-1940s blackshirted Germans. Maybe it's not a coincidence that Alison Doody of Dr. Elsa Schneider fame plays the evil British matriarch here.) The plot is basic and everyone outside the superpowered leads is a one-note caricature. It's ultimately tantamount to The Fast&Furious Win The American Revolution filtered through a stereotypically Bollywood lens.It clearly wasn't made to meet Western cinematic expectations and that's great; but I'm puzzled by the Western critical love it's gotten. I suspect it has less to do with the movie's objective merit and more to do with the soft snobbery of low expectations - and that praising a movie with anti-colonialist, borderline radical messaging is a lazy way for the entertainment media to signal its progressive bona fides.",6/10,positive

praptialam,"I watch films from all around the world in all genres. However, I didn't intend to watch this film. Because South Indian commercial films, while entertaining, are not really my cup of tea. But it was the reviews for this movie that really got my attention. Literally, they claim that this is an Oscar contender. I mean, I get that these movies are novel to them. They were therefore fascinated by it. But I thought it was over the top and foolish. I mean, while watching that, I actually laughed a lot. In this movie, there is no logic. Observing this will leave scientists completely perplexed. In this film, everything they have previously taught is a lie.Well, there are some positive aspects to this film. The production quality is incredible. Great performances are made. The stunning cinematography and excellent background music are the icing on the cake. Overall, though, this film is little more than the usual masala flick that we have been seeing for years.

DrTuvok,"This quote appears ironically at the end of RRR, and it seems a bit off. (Wouldn't 'British Empire' be more appropriate?) Throughout the film the cartoonishly exaggerated Brits speak in a stilted way that adds greatly to the comic effect in this crazy, borderline absurdist experience.Obviously writer/director SS Rajamouli can't compete with the $200+ million blimps regularly puked out from Hollywood, at least in terms of effects and cinematography. Much of the environments look flat and sterile with obvious CGI supplements and bright, TV-show-style lighting. It's only when the storytelling and goofy exaggeration come into play that these downsides can be overlooked, and so one must enter the film with an open mind for it to work. The storytelling is the director's sharpest skill; I always thought Indian films existed in their own cultural world, with no intention of appealing to Western audiences, explaining why they seem to gain little recognition internationally. RRR is still an Indian movie through and through, especially with the musical sequences, but Rajamouli has concocted a highly dramatic, visual, almost mythic story involving friendship, betrayal, plot reversals, warfare, etc, which can really appeal to anyone regardless of nationality. He seems to be taking inspiration from Mel Gibson's directorial efforts in this regard; and indeed he seems to have embarked on a Gibson binge before directing. (There's a flogging scene that manages to evoke both the Passion and the Braveheart execution, while a later gag with a falling tree references Apocalypto).The end result is something that actually benefits from being produced outside Hollywood. It's refreshingly, impossibly free of the dull speechifying that has recently dominated Western filmmaking, unless one wants to count those broad anti-imperialist strokes. And even these lack the self-loathing baggage that a modern Western writer/director would bring. Its agenda exists somewhere else entirely. The ending musical scene seems like outright propaganda though I have no clue what it's supposed to be saying.'The Sun never sets on the English Empire'. The line could almost be a meta-ironic commentary: maybe it refers to the domination of the English language in world film since the sound era, a power which just might be collapsing.",7/10,negative

sameerlodaya,Sameer lodayaThe movie is a HUGE entertainer and it has to be because it's RAJAMOULIthe story is simple of two characters who fights for their purposes but it has presented in a very HUGE way..the entry of two heroes were extravaganza and was beyond imagination..the action was terrific and thumping.. the dance sequence showed In a song were very unique and energetic..the director has kept his brand and delivered more than expectations..both the heroes played their roles according to the directors HUGE brand..the impact of the scenes can be felt as audiences were whistling and howling..your expectations to see a BAAHUBALI makers film will not failThe negative parts are both alia and ajay were kept for Hindi audiences and were given very tiny roles...some scenes were over dramatic and nearly to ham scenes..songs were not up to the mark..at times you will feel the movie is dragged and loses its paceSee it in 3d.,7/10,positive
Jithindurden,"The first Rajamouli film I saw was Magadheera. It was a revelation at that time for me that an Indian action film can look this good. The way it combined its own version of mythology and made it so good was something that really blew my mind even though I had so many issues during the modern times in that movie. But I could see that was some Telugu commercial filmmaking that was needed at that time. Then Eega with its crazy fly revenge felt even better. Then Bahubali became a national sensation but even though I liked that film, I was disappointed because I felt like Magadheera should have been the success Bahubali was. Other than the great war scenes and a few things here and there I didn't really like it as much as the previous two films I liked. Bahubali 2 was an even bigger disappointment as I didn't like it at all. So I was going into RRR with caution but it easily became my favourite film of his.Right from the start, with the intro of Ramcharan, there were many things about it that defied expectations. We see the hero of the movie in a completely negative light in an impossible action setpiece. The scene is crafted in such a way that even if we know that is not possible, we don't question it. The film is filled with so many moments like that where the action setpieces blow your mind and if these action scenes are shown any differently it would not work. The entry of Jr. NTR during the action scene right before the interval was another moment that was mindblowing.The use of patriotism and the mythological parallels were beautifully done. Even the wind rousing the character at a moment felt like it is referencing Bheem/Hanuman, the name and the action done by that character being sons of Vayu, the wind god in mythology. There are a lot of issues in the film, but the existence of this film in this form itself is a wonder as far as I'm concerned. The best film to come out under the so-called ""pan-Indian"" label.",8/10,positive
tkmce2008,"After a delay of almost 2 years, SS Rajamouli's latest magnum opus is finally here. A film that needs to be watched on the big screen to be appreciated for the effort gone into making it. Rajamouli knows his audience really well and the thunderous response that RRR is receiving is proof of that.RRR follows a familiar template; one that is common to all action films. Two ripped action heroes burst into the screen ridding on expensive set pieces. They meet and their bromance develops but later they realise that they were meant to stop each other. But a few scenes later, they reconcile and join forces. Apply this to the pre-independence era or 100 years later; the result is the same.Rajamouli is a filmmaker, who lies squarely in between Bhansali & Gowarikar. He goes big with all the grandeur but the plot doesn't match up to all the grandeur. The film stars Ram Charan as Alluri Sitarama Raju (a Telugu revolutionary) & Jr NTR plays Komaram Bheem (revolutionary leader from the Gond tribes). RRR is an entirely fictional story: ""what if the two revolutionaries had met in real life"". I loved NTR's performance the most and the bromance between the leads in the first half. But the second half leaves you disappointed with the usual heavy flying objects and humans. Alia Bhatt, Ajay Devgn, Ray Stevenson, Shriya Saran, Olivia Morris, Alison Doody, Rahul Ramakrishna co-starPersonally, I liked RRR more than the two part Bahubali. Bahubali was stretched into two films for no reason & the film was ultimately a big bore. But with RRR, we get a more entertaining and well-paced plot with better performances, high-octane set pieces and foot tapping songs.RRR has a pulsating and highly entertaining first half (more grounded in terms of set pieces as well). But post-interval, it starts to drag to such an extent that even the bow wielding Ram Charan & the bike flipping NTR Jr. Can't save it.",6/10,positive
devskumarn,What a movie!! Visually stunning. Direction is top class. NTR proved himself as a top class actor and literally acted with his eyes. Charan's screen presence and settled acting is a huge asset.,10/10,positive
Grey_rainbow,"The hype for this movie was unreal. But it ended up being just ok-ish, at best. If you dont know anything about the actors playing the heroes in the movie, like me, you will get bored at many points. This movie could be a great treat for mad fans of those celebrities, but the same doesn't hold for non-Telugu audience.Coming to the making, the thing that bothered me the most was CGI. For the budget, I was expecting much better CGI than Bahubali, but it was just as bad. BB was first such big movie, so the poor CGI was ignored by most. But here, the makers have no excuse as they have spent a ton of money and it has been nearly 6-7 years since BB, so technology has advanced as well. Even a simple fort, crowds, or some bird-view shots of the ground look cheesy. Possibly, the makers spent all the money on marketing and forgot about the product.Overall, it's an average movie. Dont buy the hype, keep your expectations low, and you wont be disappointed.",7/10,positive
Shogunrules,"Pushing too much air( rajamouli, ram charan, ntr)into already punctured tube(punctures: weak storyline, poor graphics, long boring fights, horrible costumes, superficial villan). They have the brand but poor execution. Don't go with the hype watch in tv.",3/10,negative
vermaamiteshjsr,"The movie holds up to the expectations of the BAHUBALI franchise. RAJAMOULI delivers yet another masterpiece.The film rides on its impeccable storyline, breathtaking cinematography, ample moments which will give you goosebumps and the background score which is absolutely brilliant by MM KEERAVANI; all the elements portrayed beautifully on the canvas of freedom struggle.CHARAN and NTR get the maximum screen time among the actors with CHARAN clearly taking the lead among the two. AJAY DEVGN, ALIA BHATT lend good support for the limited screen time they have.The story has been written keeping CHARAN's character RAM in mind as he explodes into all the different shades of his character and does complete justice to them.Overall, RRR has a fabulous first half and a slightly underwhelming and stretchy, but thoroughly engaging second half. If you are a fan of either of the stars, watching RRR is a no brainer decision. In case, you are not, the grandeur, larger than life making makes it a sure shot watch.This one is worth the wait and will surely hit the box office numbers out of the park.PS: Wait till the end credits for a cameo by RAJAMOULI.",9/10,positive

Benjamin-M-Weilert,"While I have watched some of the ""classics"" of Indian cinema, I haven't kept up to date on this brand of foreign cinema. Nothing stood out enough for me to seek it out and watch it. That was until a friend of mine suggested I watch RRR (2022). He described it as the most ""anime-style live-action movie"" he'd ever seen. This intrigued me, so I watched it. He wasn't wrong. It oozes machismo while also telling a compelling story about fighting against British occupation. And just to make sure that you know it's an Indian film, there's a great song and dance sequence that won an Oscar for Best Original Song.RRR reads a bit more like an American action film, especially in how ridiculous it is. Of course, that's part of the reason I really love this movie. Sure, there's a lot of violence, but the creative ways that it's used made me laugh out loud at least a few times. Even despite its 3-hour runtime, there are enough action set-pieces scattered throughout to make its pacing fast enough to never lose interest. That these action sequences seem to one-up themselves just adds to the enjoyment.Movies are made from many parts working together, and RRR has all of them working on all cylinders. Acting, directing, cinematography, sound, and music are all superb, thus creating a superb product. Even the CGI animals (which are a little jarring at first) are a great addition in a few pivotal scenes. My only disappointment comes not from the film itself, but that I can't own it outright. That I have to have Netflix to watch this film at all is a disservice to the masterpiece that everyone should watch.A magnificent hyper-action movie from India, I give RRR 5.0 stars out of 5.",10/10,positive
bertoid,"The movie may have been three hours long, but kept moving the whole time. It did what a movie was supposed to do-entertain. Great music, special effects, and plot. It was even quite funny at times. My wife who has an aversion to war movies, loved it. She only had to leave for two minutes during one torture scene. Some people have said the cruelty of the British was exaggerated. Yes the governor and his wife were depicted in a cartoonish way as villains. But Britain was quite ruthless as a colonial power. British troops would fire on innocent protestors. In the famine of 1943 grain was shipped from India to Britain, as three million died of starvation.",10/10,negative

arnaveluri,"It was a fanatical experience of watching the movie in the theatre with a huge response from the die-hard fans of Ram Charan and Tarak in the Indian Film Industry.Pro's:
1. Music and Sound: M. M Keeravani has nailed it with his music after his success with Bahubali.2. Direction: SS Rajamouli has taken the seat as the King in the film making fraternity throughout the Indian Cinema. Post success of his Blockbuster movie Bahubali. With his superb direction he showed the people the true meaning of emotions in the films along with nailing the pre-interval scene by nailing the suspense.3. Acting: Tarak and Ram Charan have made a huge impact on their new duo with their massy and classy acting. Along with the Hollywood duo of Olivia Morris and Ray Stevenson who play as a huge antagonist in this movie. In the beginning Rahul Ramakrishna nails his acting playing a minor and crucial role in his first movie with the director.Con's
1. Alia Bhatt with her first movie in Telugu didn't not make a huge response with small cameo roles for her in the movie. Along with Ajay Devgan playing a minor role in the movie.To sum up the review ""It is a must watch movie in the theatre to know the true emotion behind the story and to experience the story. Along with experiencing the fanatical following of the actors and the director.""",9/10,positive
Moviecritic200432,"So some context to what I'm about to say, I watched this movies in the theater on the second day it released, there is some talks about cutting the movie and changing some things so if they do I would change my review, but I can guarantee not by a lot. Lets go in order as there is a lot to cover in this 3 hour film. First lets start which the fact that its 3 hours long, as a surprise to when I did my research of this film I found out that it was going to be nearly 4 hours long originally, now I will go over why cutting the movies down to 3 hours was a good move later but that's just a piece of information it would be good to know. Lets begin with the storyline, to say in simple words its boring, usually in these types of movies there is some sort of twist or turn that keeps things interesting, but not this one. The story is extremely linear and there is a good chance you could predict the whole movies by watching the first 30 minutes. Not to mention most the story flashbacks and the characters motives are revealed in the first half of the movie ,this means there was no reason to even watch the second half because we know what happened already. This is something that I think is pretty dumb because if you are going to make a 3 hour long movie you need to keep the audience engaged and revealing most the stuff in the first half is doing the exact opposite of that. If we are looking at the general storyline its pretty bland and the action mostly saves the large amount of loopholes and illogical scenes. Next lets talk characters, this was a pretty big mess. So just by watching the movies its obvious that Ram Charan's character had a lot more effort put into it than Jr NTRs character. This is pretty obvious when they go into their flashbacks and motives, also when they are in emotional scenes. Ram Charan seemed more motivated to his cause than Jr NTR seemed to his. Over all Jr NTRs character could have used some work. On a side note there were character like Alia Bhatt and Samurthrakani who posed no significance and were practically useless in this movies, I would have rather preferred that there were less significant actors in their roles because they barely got screen time and it was disappointing to the select audience that are fans and had come to watch the movies for them. Ok now lets talk about the logic and loopholes. Now I can't go over all of them because I would be here all day. Now getting past the Physical logicality of this movies has to be done because in pretty much every scenes there is no regard to the physical world of things and that is evident when he jump across 3 barrels in the first scene. Lets talk storyline logic, so one thing that is really stupid is that there is no regard to the period language and attitude. The British speak modern day English and it really takes away the whole period era vibes. Also this is more of a nitpick but the uniforms and ranks of the officer are incorrect and this shows that there wasn't much effort put into these parts. Now I'm only going to go over one more loophole as there is simply too many. So in Ram's flashback scene it is shows that the British was sent by the government to arrest the militia leader and break the militia up, a bunch of people died and the rest escaped, then later in the movies it is shown that the British government sent a letter to Seetha who is part of the still active militia, now if they knew her address why didn't they just send people to go arrest them and detain them, they are still a active militia and the British government already tried once to capture them and failed so wouldn't they try to capture them again if they knew where they were. So those are the main problems, some side issues include the fact that the 2 main characters basically killed a bunch of innocent people, now some of the British soldiers were bad people but not all of them, in the scenes where they kill multiple soldiers they can't all be bad people ,they are just fighting for their country. Now the main characters get away with this and they feel no guilt at all as if they are taking more lives of the innocent than saving. There is more to talk about and I may extend my review later but in the conclusion you should still go watch this movies in the theaters because the movies was originally said to release in 2020 and the director and crew have gone through a lot to produce this movie after jumping through lots of hurdles, its evident that SS Rajamouli put passion in to this and that is always appreciated, so turn off your brain and watch the movie and you will enjoy it.",6/10,negative
nummy_unagi,"Think of your favorite movie. Now, throw it into the garbage because it is crap compared to RRR.That's a bold statement but RRR is a bold movie.The cinematography, story, action, drama, soundtrack, romance, symbolism, outrageousness, symmetry, continuity, revolutionism, friendship.... Oh, the friendship!The structure of the movie is simply stunning! It hooks you in, gets you rooting for both the protagonist and antagonist at the same time. The drama, the revolutionism and the love story bring tears to my eyes.Critics say that it's not historically accurate. They say it breaks the laws of physics. Did Marty McFly actually travel back to 1955 in Back to the Future? Did Forest Gump teach Elvis how to dance? Did Marcus Aurelius want to return power to the senate in real life? No, but he did in Gladiator to make a compelling story. Take any historical fiction movie that you liked and compare it to RRR.Absolute A+Da da dum da da dum dum!",10/10,positive
heath-jeffrey,"A movie that's basically a meme - achieving success and high ratings from hype and little else.To be fair, the story is epic. Although, at over 3hrs, you'd expect that, key points in the plot unfold at just the right time and integrate flashbacks and coincidences pretty well.Beyond that, it's pretty bad. Of the two main actors, one is pretty good but spends too much time posing for action posters, and the other is blank-faced throughout. Of the secondary characters, two women are pretty decent actors, and a few others with bit roles are okay. But none of the British antagonists seem to be actual actors at all - more like expats who happen to live and work in the area and were used just because they were 'white'.Mostly, so much happens that is cheesy and ridiculous, that it's simply not that good a movie. I enjoyed some of the cultural elements, and think it's a positive thing that it gives more exposure to the way the history of British colonialism is viewed in many nations. But it's like watching something acted and directed by children most of the time, and I have no idea why it was so hyped up.",6/10,positive
viveck_thakur,"How can so many people misread one movie so badly or am I missing something? If this movies receive so much appreciation India should have had multiple Academy wins but that is not the case for two reasons. One, Indian movies are acquired taste and two 80% of Indian movies are not worth it anything, let alone international recognition, same like everywhere else. But the two factors combined really puts largest movie producing country in the world behind all the other countries.Coming back to RRR, everything in this movie is way over the top and two protagonist are mightier than superheroes. Even Captain America will give in if barely given food for two weeks but our hero barely loses a muscle and he is not just hungry but wounded as well. Other protagonist doesn't even squeeze his eyebrows when whipped by barbed whip and doesn't flinch releasing wild animals in a party when there can be women and children present. The emotions are so basic and solution so convenient. Most Englishmen seen in the movie do not have a shred of decency and are de facto villains. Movie that is so colorful all the characters are either black or white. Compared to villains in this movie, Thanos will be a saint and Avengers will be ashamed of themselves for killing him.To sum it up, it is beyond me that this movie is getting so much recognition. This can't be happening. It can't be right.",5/10,negative

nadkarnisumeet,"RRR review :The one movie which came in my mind after watching Rajamouli's three hour plus extravaganza is the late Manmohan Desai's Mard (1985). Like Desai's last hit, RRR is all about fighting against British who are depicted here as blood sucking vampires, no less! In fact, one British General's wife demands more blood and gore as she witnesses the public flogging of a lead actor. Oofff!!By the way, the British are not just mere murderers but also randomly pick up innocent children from their village for a pound or two. The entire three hour screenplay is dedicated to bringing this child back from their evil clutches. Woah!!Unlike his previous Bahubali (2015), Rajamouli has chosen a flimsy plot this time and though he infuses his trademark dazzle and grandeur, the end result is nowhere close to his erstwhile blockbuster. Yup, we get many breathtaking visuals and superbly choreographed action setpieces but RRR just doesn't hold on the whole. In one scene, we see NTR Jr. Holding a vintage motorcycle and then throwing it like a frisbee on his opponent. Oh, and we blame poor John Abraham in Bollywood for doing the same!!Of the cast, Junior NTR and Ram Charan are both brilliant and their onscreen camaraderie reminded me of Dharam-Jeetendra in Desai's another hit Dharam Veer (1977). Thats the thing with RRR...it makes you nostalgic of all those Bollywood excesses of yore. The times when we applauded the hero bashing up a few thousands single handedly (Ram Charan's intro for example) or taming a tiger with his bare hands (NTR's great grand entry). Growwlll! This is a typical vintage masala flick presented on a spectacular scale in 3D with some four hundred crores worth of investment. Offo!!Not that I am against all yesteryear masala entertainers but in today's world, a four hundred crores magnum opus which can only afford to bring back nostalgia of those classic entertainers then made with significant budget constraints cannot be wholeheartedly appreciated. Please!!Bollywood stars Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt appear in cameos just to make the film saleable in the Hindi belt. Devgn gets two scenes. Alia gets three. There is zero value add from these two!! The British actors are so caricaturish that perhaps, even animation would work fine in place of humans; I kid you not!!On the positive, the production values are top notch, the VFX is reasonably impressive (first hour specially) and the climactic transformation of Ram Charan in to Lord Ram's avatar is an interesting twist which drew loud whistles in the half empty Paradise Cinema, Mahim I visited first day first show. Sadly, the rest of the movie was all deja vu!!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",6/10,positive
missmishka,"I had this on my Netflix watchlist since the Honest Trailer came out on YouTube, but didn't actually watch it until Naatu Naatu won Best Original Song at the Oscars. The 3 hour runtime and the fact that I like to watch movies with the original language audio and English subtitles meaning I have to read while I watch is why I waited so long to view it. It's hard for me to go 3 hours without doing something on my phone that keeps me from focusing 100% on watching something that I also need to read. I say all of this just to explain what a WOW experience watching this movie was for me. The 3 hours flew by with me glued to the TV screen and doing nothing with my phone until the movie was over and writing this review is the first thing I'm doing with that phone back in hand.This movie is spectacular. It has EVERYTHING. Any/all hype that you have heard is absolutely worth it. I can see why it was such a hit on streaming. I can't see why Best Song was the only category that it was nominated in because it was worthy of so much more recognition. Keeping this spoiler free, I just have to say that the writing, acting, editing and effects were perfect. The plot points revealed and played out in ways that made sense and impact. Are there incredibly ridiculous moments and plot points? Gods, yes, and I LOVED every one of them. It feels like forever since I watched something that was so riveting and energizing. I laughed so much. I gasped and yelled at the TV so many times. After 3 hours watching it, I honestly want to just play it again. I still hear the music in my head and can vividly remember the dancing. When I say that I loved this, I mean I LOVED this movie. The experience that I would have missed had I ignored or forgotten this on my watchlist. If you're able to, WATCH THIS MOVIE. If, like me, you're an American with limited exposure to Indian movies then you'll have no idea what you're in for or missing unless you watch this. My only regret is that I didn't watch it as soon as it came on my radar. I have no idea how representative this movie is of other Indian action films, but I am absolutely going to look for and watch more. If they're not as good, I can always rewatch this. If it leaves streaming, I will absolutely buy a hard and digital copy.Am I clear yet on how much I loved this movie?",10/10,positive
Movi3DO,"I usually don't dig Bollywood movies that were too over-the-top, which is like most Bollywood movies. However, I gotta give it to RRR for making it actually fun and exciting.Horrendous CGI aside, the dance scenes were super dope, especially that dance battle. Me and my boy actually wanted to give the dance a try. It won't be that good, but the point is that the actors were damn entertaining and amazing executing those moves.The action scenes were just as badass. It's so hilariously ridiculous and stupid that I loved it. It's basically a superhero movie. The two actors were also the important part that made these scenes entertaining.The story itself was not bad, even though it dragged so much during the middle part. I was bored for a good chunk, waiting for more action scenes. The backstories didn't really add much to the present plot, even though they provided some more fun action. And of course, I didn't feel any emotional connection to any of the characters, as I just wanted this movie to be all about the over-the-top action.Overall, it's a highly entertaining movie that I had a great time even though there's still many problems with it. 7.5/10.",7/10,positive

The scenes with Alia and NTR in pre climax make you roll out tears and the RC transformation to Alluri getup makes you clap in the theater. Wonderful experience.

nagarajugumpenapalli,"After Bahubali Series we can definitely say that RRR will be the another Master Piece of Emotions from SS Rajamouli.The Storyline is Predictable but the visuals and Performances dominated it.Asusual Rajamouli Direction and Screenplay is Flawless but need to keep 1 thing on mind about the runtime which is Too lengthy.DOP by Senthil is too good which we can witness in some Sequences with Close shots.Hatsoff to Srinivasmohan and Sabu Cyril for their work.MM. Keeravani asusual made his mark with the BGM and Komaram Bheemudo song mesmerises everyone. Naatu Naatu song was Brilliant first time ever I have seen that everyone enjoyed the song in Theatre continuous whistles.When Coming to the Characterisations of two lead actors.Komaram Bheem Characterisation was Brilliant, felt like watching the real Bheem in the Screen. NTR made me Cry with his Performance.RamaRaju Characterisation was also Good but not as expected when Compared to the 1st half of the Film. In the 1st Half RamCharan Literally raised Goosebumps with his Performance. But the Wig which is used is not as good as in the End of the Film.Overall Brilliant Visual Extravaganza.

RAM CHARAN AND NTR THEY ARE EXCELLENT 😎😎😎IN THEIR ROLES , Alie was a good charector, OLIVIA MORRIS AND NTR was relationship was excellent.

Bhomiq,"I never thought going into the movies with my family that very first week this came out that it would become a huge hit internationally--or that it would win a fricking Oscar. Crazy. But I'm honestly glad that this movie was the one chosen to represent our movies and an industry that has such a wide array of talent.You have to suspend belief a lot with these types of movies but that's really what entertainment is. And sure, the CGI is cringe, but India really doesn't have the top tier CGI technology that America has and they sure as heck don't invest a lot of money into it because it's not considered the most important aspect of Indian cinema. Putting questionable CGI aside, I still loved every second of the crazy fight scenes. They were so over the top (even by my standards) that it was truly a fun watch. The background music for each titular character (Ram's was my favourite) always ALWAYS hyped me up. I could literally feel my blood pumping in my veins during his intro when he fought off literally hundreds of men. That one scene where everyone started piling on top of him and we were inside with him, hearing his heavy breathing and feeling the claustrophobia was a masterpiece. Usually the hero gets up and then they just fly off but we were shown every fight decision Ram chose to make and breaking that scene down little by little made it more easier for the audience to believe.This is a movie that Hollywood would and could never recreate. A movie where two men love each other like brothers and is unapologetic for it with amazing action sequences that have you literally squealing in your seat. I'm used to 3 hour movies and with some movies you can reaaaally feel it but with this? It was all over too soon.Ram Charan never disappoints. He's eye candy but dang, can the man act AND dance. It deserved that award for the song but honestly, it deserved the best foreign film award as well.",8/10,positive

anchitbaishya2004,"RRR or RISE ROAR REVOLT is a grand spectacle of a movie. Firstly, S. S. Rajamouli's direction is INCRRREDIBLE!!!! I've seen a lot of movies from Bollywood, Hollywood and Tollywood but the direction in this movie is just out of the park. Second, the visuals. RRR is a visual marvel packed with some of the best use CGI effects in Indian Cinema especially during the battle scene with all the animals and the final battle between our two leads and the British Soldiers ( though it does look a little cheap at points but it's not that big of a deal. Most of it is handled really well.) Third, The performances. Jr. NTR and Ram Charan delivers some of the most incredible performances as Bheem and Raju respectively. They breathe so much power and emotions into their characters that you can't take your eyes off of 'em. And finally, the story. Even though it's another movie about freedom fighters struggling to put an end to the British Raj, the story in RRR feels so fresh and engaging that you can't help but get hooked up with it immediately. And the Dance sequences and musical numbers. Well.......both Bollywood and Hollywood are comparatively nothing. Holy Cow!!!The Naatu Naatu sequence took my breath away and ever since I can't stop watching the whole scene again and again. Also the songs in this work extremely well with the story and are very meaningful unlike most of the Bollywood movies where the musical numbers don't contribute anything to the storyline. The movie incorporates so many genres like action, adventure, music, rom-com to name a few, which on paper shouldn't work, but this movie succeeds brilliantly in doing so.I'm so proud of this movie and so happy and delighted to see it capturing the heart's of audiences across the globe and becoming the most watched Indian film on Netflix and one of the most successful Indian movies ever at the box office. RRR is a pure definition of brilliance in filmmaking. You just cannot miss this Masterpiece!!! 9.6/10.",10/10,positive
Rajit_thebingewatcher,"Rajamouli is known for making larger than life movies . This is also same. Following up the adaptation of Ramayana the story portrays english empire as cruel (ok to believe) and stupid at the same time (this one is hard to digest) . Had high hopes after the buzz but did not leave upto the expectations. Lots of plot holes.Specially focus on the female characters one is given the role of sita (Aliya Bhat). I wonder why she chose this role after classics like raji,udta punjab. It has 0 character arch. She just waits for his Ram. And another one is given the role of ""bibhishan"" . It's a classic case with what not do with female characters. RRR is a world of just masculinity where women are the props.If you are watching you ll be able to see the rajamoulies grandiose but the craft, screen play is truelle missing in this movie.",6/10,positive
ashutoshactive,"""RRR,"" directed by S. S. Rajamouli, is a cinematic spectacle that lives up to the director's reputation for grandeur and storytelling. Released in 2022, the film is a magnum opus set against the backdrop of the pre-independence era, featuring an ensemble cast led by N. T. Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan, and Alia Bhatt.At its core, ""RRR"" is a tale of friendship, freedom, and the indomitable spirit of individuals. The narrative unfolds with two fictional characters, played by NTR and Ram Charan, who embody the spirit of Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, legendary freedom fighters from South India. The film seamlessly weaves history and fiction, creating a visually stunning and emotionally resonant narrative.The strength of ""RRR"" lies in its breathtaking visuals and meticulously choreographed action sequences. Rajamouli's vision is evident in every frame, from the vibrant landscapes to the intricately designed sets. The film's action sequences, including the climactic battle, are a visual treat, combining stellar performances with top-notch special effects. Must watch.",8/10,positive
Sees All,"What can I say about RRR? On one level, it's preposterous, ridiculous, and just plain stupid. However, it is also very entertaining. The near-capacity audience that I saw it with laughed all the way through it. It's an Indian movie and has most of the elements that make movies big hits in India: songs and dances (often popping up in the strangest situations), lots of martial arts scenes, violence and bloodshed attached to basically simplistic stories with innocent good guys and truly evil bad guys. Since the story takes place during the British Raj, it's the British who are the villains and the poor Indian villagers who are the victims. The story starts when a group of British aristocrats decide to take a little native girl who sings prettily away from her village and bring her to live in their household to entertain their guests. Her family does not want her to leave. The British throw a few coins at them and take the child anyway, (knocking the mother in the head during the process). The villagers are determined to get the girl back; the British are determined to show these ""brown trash"" who's boss. There are two attractive young men fighting on opposite sides in this struggle. They don't know that they are on opposite sides and swear fast friendship. You can only imagine the havoc that is wreaked when the truth is revealed to them, as both of them have superhuman strength. Their fights are elaborate and spectacular, no doubt inspired by the battles between Rama and the demons in THE RAMAYANA. Out of bullets? Just pick up your motorcycle and beat your opponent to death with it. The two guys are also great dancers (thanks to the aid of CGI). It all ends happily despite all the carnage. It's fun, but it's also long-more than 3 hours with an intermission. This film was awarded the New York Film Critics Award for Best Director. My question is: where does film direction end, and computer programming begin? The whole film looks like a violent video game. The good guys are pure of heart and look it. The bad Brits are an unattractive lot (fat and hairy for the most part); the head villainess looks remarkably like Jocelyn Wildenstein! RRR is entertaining, but I felt a little guilty about spending more than three hours viewing it. Would I recommend it? Only with an audience to laugh along with you.",6/10,positive

My favorite scene was when Bheem was ordered to arrest a man in a crowd of 1000 people and he said no problem. Fights his way through the crowd and brings him back.

A-Thunder,"I love everything about this movie, but especially it's message about the love between friends. Despite the majority of the movie revolving around violent and grotesque action sequences, the underlying current about the trials, tribulations, and love in friendship elevates this film to a masterpiece in its own right. It not only sets up the bonds of friendship and ties them in thick knots right before the audiences eyes, but also allows the influences of historical events (mainly colonialism) to try to fray and cut at those bonds which we, the audience, have grown to care about.Although the violence is galore and the action scenes somewhat over-the-top, the cinematography and plot behind the scenes is just so cool and moments are so fueled with a folklore-like quality that the excess of the scenes works and flows well. I was on the edge of the seat for the entire film!Months later and certain scenes still stick with me, as well as the music.Overall, excellent and universal message - what do friends do when they find themselves on opposite sides? And, what matters justify breaking the bonds of true friendship?",9/10,positive
Nestor_Sanchez,"Can't deny that in the visual department this movie delivers. Sets, art direction, costumes, color grading, lighting.. all are top notch and the score is good too, but technical prowess cannot make up for the terrible story and overly ridiculous and forced action scenes. Might be slighty entertaining if you shut your brain off (coma level) which is difficult when
from the start you're thrown into a ridiculous scene that makes the Matrix Brawling fight look like sanitized and serious choreography. The story has been n done many times before and nothing had real substance to it. Ridiculousness can work, Everything Everywhere All At Once did it a few months ago for example, but here it just felt like too much filler, too much crazy for the sake of it.3 stars for the great tech specs.",7/10,negative

brentsbulletinboard,"The Bollywood style of filmmaking has, arguably, become a distinct genre all its own, characterized by long, visually dazzling movies filled with action sequences on steroids, hyper-energized music video segments (regardless if relevant to the story), and glamorously designed costumes, hair and makeup. It's definitely an acquired taste and eminently commercial, but it's not exactly something one could characterize as epic, groundbreaking cinema. Which is why I'm stunned by all of the attention and awards season buzz that's being showered on this over-the-top offering, one that's fairly typical of releases in this genre. In this hypothetical ""what if"" tale about a fictitious meeting between a pair of Indian freedom fighters who struggled against brutal British colonial rule (and who never met in real life), writer-director S. S. Rajamouli takes viewers on a whirlwind action-adventure saga that's preposterous, predictable, clichéd, at times juvenile, and, above all, exhausting by the time one reaches the end of its 3+-hour runtime. The trite dialogue, corny narrative, cheesy CGI effects (particularly the film's wild animals) and monodimensional characters (most notably the big bad Brits who come across more like caricatures than villains) are all laughable, almost as much as the film's fight sequences, which play like scenes from the ""John Wick"" and ""Matrix"" franchises with a dash of martial arts flicks thrown in for good measure. In fact, were it not for the seemingly incessant runtime, this might qualify as one of those good ""bad"" offerings for a group movie night, though the film becomes tiresome about an hour in and can't adequately sustain that sense of high camp for more than 180 minutes. In its defense, the picture's choreography in the musical sequences is commendable (if at times it's like watching a protracted aerobics class), and the costumes, art direction and set design are all noteworthy (save, of course, for a shattered marble railing in one scene that looks like the Styrofoam from which it appears to have been made). Given all of the foregoing, however, I'm truly perplexed why this release has been singled out from the other films in this genre as the beneficiary of such generous awards season recognition, perhaps other than the fact that it has been a huge box office hit worldwide, which may well have something to do with that. But is that milestone enough to drive the ample bestowing of such accolades? Remember, popcorn may qualify as a great snack, but it certainly does not a meal make.",3/10,positive

kranthireddyg,Stellar performances from NTR.

CaptainFahim,"No logic can be found in the entire film. There are similar masala films all over India, but none have received the same level of attention in Hollywood. These films are intended for general moviegoers. This was by no means an exception. For some strange reason, it seemed to be very popular in Hollywood. It was well-received by critics, filmmakers, and viewers. Strangely enough, these are the same people who hate superhero movies, especially those that are part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), where this movie also lacks logic. Once again, it is demonstrated that these people despise and fear superhero movies for no apparent reason. They are following in their babas' footsteps, who declared, ""I hate superhero movies, and you should, too."" Otherwise, they will not be referred to as ""cinephiles!""

Then throughout the movie the superb performance of both the leading character is bang on! The story is very strong, with full of Indian movies masala elements, set in pre-independence era 1920s around Delhi.Overall I thought Ram Charan steal the show, but people will forget his role as when I think of the best moments mostly I recall is of Jr. NTR's be it remembering the name of Jenny or attacking the British Palace- my best ever screen scene in Indian movie frame, the interaction with Seeta- Alia Bhatt when he finds out Rama's reality all belongs to JrNTR. But the Ram Charan's character is better written so BOTH are equally good. Another solid performance from Ajay Devgan as freedom fighter and interesting he training arms to his people without real arms. Both the ladies Alia Bhatt and Olivia Morris done very good justice in their respective role.You need to watch this movie in the Theater and should not wait for digital release as you will enjoy the movie in much larger canvass especially the Climax portion of the movie, the early part when both Rama and Bheem meets and saves the child at the river or the scene I already mentioned when Bheem attacks the British Palace in a truck.The story penned by K.

Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris, Samuthirakani, Alison Doody, Ray Stevenson, and Olivia Morris. The film is set in 1920s Delhi and tells the fictional story of two Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Rama Rao), who fought against the British Raj.The film was released on 25 March 2022 and received mixed reviews from critics. Some critics praised the film's action sequences, visual effects, and performances, while others found the plot to be unbelievable and the action sequences to be fake.I found RRR to be a disappointing film. The plot was full of holes and the action sequences were over-the-top and unrealistic. The performances were also uneven, with some actors giving good performances and others giving wooden performances.Overall, I would not recommend RRR to anyone. It is a film that is full of potential, but it is ultimately a disappointment.Here are some of the specific problems that I had with the film:The plot was full of holes. For example, the film never explained why Raju and Bheem were so willing to risk their lives to help each other, even though they had only just met.The action sequences were over-the-top and unrealistic. For example, there was a scene where Bheem fought a tiger with his bare hands. This was clearly impossible, and it took me out of the film.The performances were uneven. N. T. Rama Rao Jr. And Ram Charan gave good performances, but Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt gave wooden performances.Overall, I was very disappointed with RRR. It is a film that is full of potential, but it is ultimately a disappointment.",,negative
santhoshraviraj,"RRR and Marvel's movie Morbius has same budget (Morbius: 575 crores and RRR: 550 crores) Yet CGI is disappointing in RRR, yes RRR Cgi is so better compared to other telugu movies. If heros stop taking 50-100 crores remuneration for a single movie then we can make better movies than Hollywood.Logic in RRR action scenes doesn't make any sense(physics defying action scenes) in Hollywood movies they atleast give us an explanation with Sci fi or fantasy elements. But in 99.98% of our movie's, hero's have supernatural strength, survives impossible and defy physics.I know this became a indian movie trope and sometimes it's enjoyable and sometimes it's goofy and crappy.RRR has great BGM, Awesome hero intro's, fantastic dance choreography, The best Elevation scenes, few Emotional scenes and great dialogues that will melt your heart, Cinematography and visuals are breathtaking i love it.But we will never improve ourselves, we still make same genric, routine commercial masala movies even with same Hollywood budget.If you are into masala commercial movie then RRR is a must watch in theaters.",6/10,positive
ramair350,"I cannot believe what an amazing film has been created. I'm on old white American guy and am ashamed to admit that I at first was hesitant to try out the film. But it was absolutely an incredible experience from start to finish. American films seem dull and drab in comparison, especially the glut of comic superhero movies that have taken over the theaters. This movie does have superhero / comic elements in some regard, but in a way that appeals to me as an adult. I hope this movie gets the notice it deserves. Without question it should be an easy Academy nominee for cinematography. But for me I will put it on an even higher pedestal: it is the best film I have seen this year, period. Well done to everyone associated with the film; your passion and love for every detail really came through and connected with me. I thank you.",10/10,positive

TheVictoriousV,"I talked about this film at great length with my brother and father at the screening we attended -- that screening being at my father's new house with the worthy home theater setup. The word ""cheesy"" came up, and whether this film is truly befitting of that term or if it simply doesn't care how cheesy you find it. Is it even a bad word?In any case, the new Indian epic RRR is, to put it mildly, a most remarkable film. A spectacle. A spectacle of the sort that, as one Letterboxd user noted, Hollywood has all but forgotten. Shifting between or mixing such genres as historical drama, action, mystery, (b)romantic comedy, and Tollywood musical, it never ceases to fire on all cylinders, is never once boring despite its 3-hour runtime, and is ultimately (in spite of being unapologetically crazy and going so over-the-top in its action set-pieces that it exits the Earth stratosphere) a deeply sincere, earnest, even inspiring film. Yes, I understand how weird this sounds if you've only seen the trailers and TikTok memes, but please do as I did with the movie and stay with me.A contemporary Hollywood production might've lampshaded the silliness of it all (so as to not alienate any normies), à la Spider-Man's mockery of the name Doctor Octopus in his most recent sequel. But because the world of RRR takes itself seriously and the work as such is ultimately genuine with its characters and story, it is simultaneously funnier and more touching than anything Hollywood has put forth in decades.Directed by S. S. Rajamouli, RRR is essentially a historical (or perhaps folkloric) fan-fic, imagining the revolutionary 19th-century figures Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem (played passionately by Ram Charan and N. T. Rama Rao Jr.) as buddy superheroes and drawing additional inspiration from Sanskrit scripture. Alay Devgn and Alia Bhatt play vital supporting roles. On the side of the British Crown, whom the director isn't afraid to depict as the most gloriously cartoonish of cartoonish villains, we see Ray Stevenson as Governor Scott Buxton and Alison Doody as his sadomasochist wife. Olivia Morris plays one of the ""good ones"" and becomes Bheem's love interest; a Love at First Sight sequence makes this as clear as visual media conceivably could.The unbridled passion isn't just in the characters, or their story of kinship, betrayal, and uproar (emphasis on ""roar""), but extends to the technical level. Like I said, no matter which genre RRR momentarily finds itself in (musical, romance, elemental Fantasy, you name it), it always goes harder than it has any right to; the cinematography, editing, sound design, fighting choreography, and production design are constantly on fire -- sometimes literally. ('Tis no surprise that this is India's costliest film production to date.) The VFX and title graphics maintain the same energy throughout, often looking like something out of Mortal Kombat.Also electrifying is the music, M. M. Keeravani's thunderous score as well as the memorable and stirring production numbers, ranging from a loveable, flawlessly coordinated dance routine to a scene where a flogged freedom fighter sings through the anguish and rouses his people to action. Unlike many Bollywood joints, RRR's song numbers meaningfully exist in the film's universe and impact its story.Last but not least, there is a method to the madness when it comes to the screenplay: things that seem like throwaway gags or zany action bits will make a pivotal, triumphant return at a later stage. There may also be symbolic foreshadowing in these moments. One critic noted the use of the Indian flag -- and how it switches hands between the two leads -- during the otherwise bonkers ""bridge sequence"".My one complaint about the movie is barely a complaint about the picture itself. It concerns the dubbing. I've been told it is standard Tollywood practice to dub over the dialogue and never record any sound during photography -- or at least not use that audio for the final cut because only ADR creates the desired booming sound. This was somewhat noticeable with the English-speaking characters, but the problem is that the most readily available, maybe ""official"" version of the movie is, for the rest of the runtime, in Hindi.Alas, all of the non-English speakers were filmed speaking Telugu and, yeah, one can tell. I'm reminded of the official release of Werckmeister Harmonies, which is in Hungarian and will often be mistaken for the ""wrong"" one by cinephiles who search for it because the lead actor spoke his native German during production. But now I'm really stretching to find something -- anything -- to dislike about this.I'm hoping RRR will be this year's Parasite -- that is, a movie that red-pills an inordinate amount of people on the fact that there exists a whole world of cinema outside the stale Hollywood bubble. Indeed, even if I've described the film in such a way that it sounds too outlandish for some, the truth is that the story and characterizations as such are largely accessible. When I describe RRR as ""the best of all worlds"" (to quote my brother), I'm not just referring to the genre mixture; it's an accessible, ultra-fun adventure on one hand, and a daringly unconventional piece of art on the other (outside of all the bonkers-ness I've mentioned, it isn't shy to put its title screen 40 minutes in, à la Gaspar Noé's Climax).Like Everything Everywhere All At Once (another ""unusually funny yet unusually serious"" work that floored a great number of people who named it the most intense cinematic experience they'd had in ages, which I'm more prepared to say about this one), RRR is a film of contradictions:It is more hilarious yet also more poignant than any other movie I've seen this year. It doesn't give a f-ck if anyone finds it too ridiculous, yet is deeply devoted to its vision and craft. It is utterly over-the-top, yet probably does justice to the plight of its subject, more so than a vanilla historical drama might've done. It is one of the best movies I've watched in recent memory, where I completely understand if some walk away thinking it's one of the worsts.",10/10,positive

If I was think that any part of it was real it makes my blood boil with hatred for the very for the British in the way they were treated, not even worth the cost of a bullet. I just loved how they used a flaming motorcycle to blow the place and killed the very evil lady that wanted to see him bleed a pool of blood at his feet. I was never so glad they got just what they deserved. It actually reminds me of how Russia is trying to control Ukraine. Just how Ukraine are fighting for their very freedom itself.

CinemaClown,"Oozing with style, swag & swashbuckling energy, RRR (Rise Roar Revolt) is as intoxicating as it is unabashedly over-the-top and is blockbuster filmmaking at its most bombastic. Told with kinetic flair and riding on restless momentum, this 3-hour long larger-than-life epic extravaganza packs a gripping plot, interesting character dynamics & charismatic leads to go along with its explosive action spectacle and is entertaining throughout.Written & directed by S. S. Rajamouli, the premise setup is neat and characters introductions are striking enough to stand out and the film only gets bigger, bolder & better as plot progresses. Rajamouli aims for maximalist entertainment here and makes his intentions clear during the first action segment only but what's more impressive is him making sure that the story fundamentals are covered before going all-in on the elaborate set pieces.Its 182 mins runtime never becomes a bother, thanks to its consistent narration & smooth flow. While the romance subplot & musical numbers are uncalled for, they are finely intertwined into the storyline. The action is ludicrous & CGI is cartoonish and yet what Rajamouli was going for with his imagination makes them work. The story rides on the bromance between its two leads and both the actors contribute with strong individual inputs while also delivering as a duo.Overall, RRR is a resounding & reverberating ride that blends history & mythology into one rip-roaring & action-packed cinematic offering that's as roisterous & ravishing as it is reductive & ridiculous at times. While it's easy to get swept away by its overwhelming rapture, flamboyant appeal & invigorating quality, the film does a fab job of juggling its narrative priorities with entertainment obligations and rises, roars & revolts enough to soar above the sea of mindless blockbusters.",,positive

So if you are giving me advice to not to compare this with bahubali then my question will be why???Excepting the comparison movie is truely for mass viewers and class viewers too.. Speciality of Rajamauli sir! Film focuses on two revolutionary superheroes and their journey throughout the life.. At these road there are many conflicts challenge them as a personality.. And these is the basic story with some special elements like fire and ice combination with mythical depictions and character portrail of Ram, Sita, Bheema and Regional moments.. Addition of over the top actions justifying two characters... (Creative actions) with remark of Rajamauli Sir's style with addition of spectacular visuals and outstanding BGM!!! Hushhh... Not over yet cause this is experience.. True cinema experience.. Yes, film is not perfect.. Yet has loopholes.. Yes feels cliche in storytelling like english actors dubbing in hindi to elaborate situation but at the same time it is epic.. mindblowing and heartwhelming too...

celinsonia,"One word it's Just Awesome!!!!Shot composition was too good which is one aspect I always appreciate in SSR movies. The use of the foreground in the earlier frames of this spectacle subtly taught us about the environment we are being transported to. Cinematography by Senthil truly blew my mind, the use of rack focuses was very unique in a minimal way. To emphasize SSRs vision, Senthil grasped the landscapes of the rural, industrial, and british raj settings of historical India using establishing shots and aerial views innovatively. The team did great work during post-production (color correction) as the warm hue that glazed the screen made everything feel that much more Indian. CGI might be my own gripe but considering the budget every penny was used effectively. Regardless, SSR knows how to immerse us into the emotional baggage of the storytelling, making us forget we are looking at CG elements altogether. An example of SSR and Senthils collaborative eye for detail was the precision of the dust after Ram beats his punching bag, ensuring the specular highlights glared off of the environment (Ram, punching bag and every spec of dust) making us feel the weight of Ram's punches.",10/10,positive

sawyerv-59360,"I had not heard of this movie in my life until a youtuber I follow briefly mentioned it as one of his favourite movies of 2022. His review lasted no more than 1 minute, but the catching images he put on screen caught my attention immediately. Unfortunately, as intrigued as I was, I thought I would never get to watch it. Sure, Netflix had a bunch of different films in it's catalogue, but I was certain my region would never get a three hour long film, and I didn't have the money for a good VPN that could help me change my region. So, as unfortunate as it was, I would have to let it slide.Jump to a couple of months later, I am browsing Netflix, trying to find a good film to have playing on the background while I draw, when a title calls my attention.""RRR""In my disbelief, I checked the runtime, the synopsis, and decided ""what the heck"" and put play.What I never could have expected is that RRR would be an experience that left me anxious, jumping up and down my seat in emotion, and that it would become my favourite film not only of this year, but of every year following this one. I won't say it's perfect for everyone, but for me? Its complete and utter perfection, I wouldn't add or subtract anything. It's three hour runtime can be overlooked as a ""negative"" and instead be appreciated as a representation of the three distinct acts this story follows. It probably will leave you a bit tired afterwards, and you may need some time before deciding to watch any other movie. But one thing's for sure: you won't regret it one bit.Do you like action films that leave you anxious due to the tension of things will turn out right or wrong?Do you like movies about war, with scenes full of bloody action?Do you like films about a revolution against oppression?Do you like movies with nonsensical action, that are not really realistic but don't really affect the final product because you are willing to suspend your disbelief?Do you like the drama of friendships between opposites and whether they will succeed or not?Do you like musical numbers?If the answer to most or all of these is yes, then you should give RRR a chance.",10/10,positive

Ram and Bheem are more superheroes than revolutionaries and the English are one-dimensional baddies, but who cares?

I'm a movie buff and I have seen a lot, a lot, I mean a lot of movies in my life of all sorts( ranges and genres even the gores). But this film truly represents what a true film direction is in it's real sense.This has got everything that is needed creative expression, entertainment, storytelling, underlying social commentary & exploration and experimentation. A blend which is quite scarce, not many films out there in recent times with which you can draw parallel here. The best buddy fillm of all time PERIOD!The intention of this film is not at all to be serious and doesn't pose it to be. You can simply compare this movie with the biggest & most fun rollercoaster ride you ever had in life. If you are someone who always likes grounded reality films then this is not your cup of tea!! Just skip it.For those who are movie enthusiasts; this is a blast of a movie. The only regret that I had while watching this film for the first time was I didn't bring anyone with me to watch this film being sceptical.This is a movie that you would love to watch with screaming friends/audience because it is so bizzare even you would scream in awe of how the reality is so boring sometimes and the escapising from life we all look for in these films is what is present in this film in abundance.Pros of this film :Great pace from start to finish!, best screenplay & direction by S S Rajamouli.Top notch execution(with negligible inconsistency in execution),Simple yet effective story writing with great camera work,Casting of this film is so well done, everyone is a character in this film and you don't see an actor, kudos!

It has everything from over-the-top fighting scenes Bruce lee sort of stuff and action throughout the whole movie. A few parts had me in tears and that takes a lot for me being an old fart in my 70's. The torture scene when Bheem is getting whipped, he starts singing is odd, but I suppose only an Indian movie can get it right.

I'm absolutely in love with this so I had to write a review about it. It's a beautiful film based on a beautiful story which I highly recommend. I'm in love with the characters.

panchalbhavesh-63503,"First it is too long movie. Few frames of few seconds were chilling and more fulfilling than entire three hours of movie. Second, background score is too harsh at times and so sound design doesn't sound natural.Third, the hindi dubbed dialogues are not very convincing for the screenplay.Art direction is good which takes you to pre-independence era.Musically it is great.",9/10,positive
raj-bhullar,Wow what a movie. I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a long time. It has some great over the top action. That dance scene was amazing. Usually I don't like songs and dance scenes in movies but this was just brilliant. If you don't like over the top action then this movie is not for you. It's a tale of two legendary people in pre-independent India. It shows how people were oppressed under the British empire. And it's realistic in that way. The racism was rampant and indians were treated like animals. This movie is a masterpiece and it had my full attention for three hours straight. And it was entertaining throughout. When I was watching I was wondering even Hollywood can't choreograph action scenes like these. It was just amazing. I don't have enough words to describe how entertaining this movie was. 10/10 must watch.,10/10,positive
akhandwa,"Epic movie from Rajamouli!RRR is a fictional story about a police officer and a man who protects his tribe. They first become friends, then there is a misunderstanding so they become enemies and finally they need a woman to bring them to senses so that they can become friends forever. BTW whilst going through their ups and downs in friendship they also defeat the British. Typical Indian STYLE.The story and acting were tolerable. Loved the action sequences. They also played with fire and water avatars, I am guessing it was inspired by ""The last Airbender"" by N Shyamalan. The sequence where NTR is being chased by a lion was thrilling. Ram Charan's action sequences are strong and heroic.Overall entertaining. Just a little too long. Tollywood has come a long way and Rajamouli is a gift to Indian cinema.",7/10,positive

cricketbat,"As strange as it sounds, RRR is a high-octane action movie/musical. At times, this film is deliciously cheesy, such as the over-the-top fight scenes and highly entertaining dance numbers. Other parts, however, were a bit too corny for my tastes. It also didn't really need to be over three hours long. They definitely took their time to get to some plot points. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my experience watching it. It's hard to dislike a movie as fun as this one. Plus, I had no concept of the true stories this fictional account was based on, so I felt like I learned something about Indian history, as well.",7/10,positive

lgomezdeurjc,"This movie is too much:Exaggerated villains, maybe the worst part of the movie, but it's still enjoyable to watch them having their asses kicked.Action scenes that you'll see in a Marvel movie but so over the top that are still enjoying.-Typical Bollywood/Tollywood musical scenes that make you dance and getting emotional (that one in the torture scene).-That very macho bromance, contrasting with corny romantic scenes,-Exagerated historical epicity.All of this and more in more of 3 hours, that sometimes can be, as maybe everything of this movie, too much.And after all of this mix, you can't stop watching and it makes you get glued to your seat.",7/10,positive
bharatntie,"Like almost every Rajamouli's movie there is almost one high octane part that is very hard to criticize. He generally does this pretty strategically, either before the 1st half or immeiditely after the 2nd half. In this movie it is the flogging of Jr. NTR and the subtle relecutance by Ram, add to that the excellent back ground score, lyrics and the defiance shown by Jr. NTR (which was a lot more natural)..Also the glommy lighting to reflect the dark moment and Bheema's defiance, i was hooked for those 10 minutes.Take that scene out, the movie is underwhelming. I sincerly thought they were going to show some events from the lives of original historical figures, and how they sabotaged the colonial powers, and felt they could have taken some liberties with the timelines and come up with at cohesive story there are plenty of movies that did that. You need juvenlie mindset to think, that a lack of actual historical context can be compensated by quickly putting together an equally juvenile and corny (poster presentation of Indian freedom fighters) end credit scenes. A quick wikipedia search indiciates a blaring inaccuracy of history, i do not wish to argue with anyone who thinks otherwise,I think it is a project to elevate Jr. NTR and Ram Charan, nothing more.At the end of Shawshank Redemption you have a huge sense of gratification when the antagonist shoots himself. In RRR both the antagonists were huge let downs, especially the female actress who i think they no doubt fished out of some reject bucket. Their maliciousness was comical at best, their presence and their dialogues is a cause for rib tickling laughter. We get it, we get it ....the Colnel thinks the logistics of shipping a bullet is far more valuable than the life of an Indian, you have to have more reasons for the audience to despise the antagnoist.Until now The Dark Knight is the only movie i have seen where the intensity in a 15 minutes block never drops below 8/10, it always kept you on the edge of the seat. Unfortunately like every Rajamouli movie it has fluff for most part,assumiing his movies typicallly run between 150 to 180 minutes divided into blocks of 15/18 minutes there is just 1 block is like 10/10 then 2 blocks at best are 6/10 the remaining 7 fall between 1-5, Think about the RRR movie dispassionately there are may be 1 block (i mentioned above that was a 10), Ram introduction was not very unique Jr. NTR's intro was a litte bit unique but still over the top...the rest of the blocks were not something you have not seen before. The pre-intermission scene and the final fight were comical at best So there is nothing new Mr. Rajamouli have shown me to be stir my enthusiam.I was very young when i watched Rang De Basanti, that is a best example of how to represent history. After these years the analyzing a litte bit critically the characters at the end may have engaged in juvenile vigilatsim. However the actions they took at the end was not a huge leap in the story, you felt after playing the charecters they were subconciously inspiried and evolved over the movie time. It was not too over the top to think what they did at the end. RRR is meant to be a revolutionary movie, but i feel other than some mindless cheap thrill entertainment (cough Avengers) i do not think it will be lodged into people's heart for a long time, other than some misguided pride for Telugu Cinema.Some western commentators are saying thiat Hollywood misses RRR sort of film similar to the 80's however after evolving as a cinema goer, i now cannot watch 10 Commandments, Brave Heart, even Gladiator. They have to show heroism in a different way.As a Telugu person i was heartened to see the industry adopting a multistarer movies. Still they have a long way but is a good start. Bringing Ram Charan and Jr. NTR could have been considred a impossible task a decade ago that probably has to do with the trust they put in Mr. Rajamouli to capture Telugu audience, Kudos for 10 minute block post interval and the bringing the stars togeher are the only saving graces for this movie.Forgive my gramatical and spelling mistakes :).",3/10,positive

nitsvirusboyz,"A visual treat, action-packed drama film will keep you entertained with its grand scale action scenes. The movie has very well-choreographed action sequences but lacks the required strong storyline. Director S. S. Rajamouli successfully delivered the mass entertainer once again. He beautifully intertwines two elements of matter 'fire and water' in the form of Rama and Bheem.Writer K. V. Vijayendra Prasad, the man behind Baahubali, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, and Manikarnika has given an ordinary story this time. The co-writer S. S. Rajamouli couldn't manage to make an ordinary story into an extraordinary one. But he knows how to engage its audience and he has done his job. The introduction scenes for both the lead actors, intermission point, and climax were whistle-worthy.Jr NTR delivers a brilliant and emotional performance. Ram Charan gave an excellent performance, his character has many variations which he showcases impressively. They both look terrific in the action scenes. Alia Bhatt and Ajay Devgn are making their debut in Telugu films. While Ajay Devgn got a well-written cameo but Alia's character could've been done with better writing. Alia Bhatt and Shriya Saran have nothing to offer here. Ray Stevenson and Alison Doody are effective as the antagonists. Olivia Morris, Edward Sonnenblick, and all other supporting casts play their parts well.The first half of RRR is a package of emotion, humour, and action. Jr NTR and Ram Charan's dancing and the choreography in 'Naacho Naacho' song deserve applause. NTR manages to bring a few laughs when he tries to befriend Olivia Morris. The screenplay in the second half is a bit slow, some scenes seem unnecessary and they were added just to increase the runtime. There was a large room for editing in the film. VFX and the cinematography were top-notch. The music and the background score were enthralling.RRR Movie Rating:
Direction 3.5/5

michellesharpe-16943,"So, I'd heard people mention RRR. I saw the little Netflix reel with the tiger and thought, ""That's kind of awesome, but I don't think that movie is for me."" But then this movie gets nominated for best foreign language film at the golden globes and I hear there's outrage that India would've won the Oscar if they'd submitted this as their submission. Then I see that this movie is mentioned on almost every single ""Best of 2022"" list of the year. Then the Critics Choice nominate it for best picture. It's pretty rare when normal internet movie folks and critics alike share a mutual love for a movie. Let alone an action movie. So I finally decided to watch it.It took me about 20-30 minutes to turn the logical part of my brain off and enjoy the spectacle. Once ""Naatu Naatu"" hit, it was over. I was on board and in love with this movie.I pitch this movie to people by saying, ""It's like a mix of golden age Hollywood/musical movies, 80's action movies, 90's war movies, and classic buddy movies into one gigantic film."" By the sounds of it, you'd think this movie would be a tonal disaster. It is not. In fact, I think this is one of the most tonally balanced movies of the year. It also juggles the time nicely. I never once got bored watching this movie, and I watched it AT HOME! It is so hard to keep my attention at home, but this movie somehow achieved that.Definitely recommend this movie.

ridi-arahan,"What worked:
I personally felt this was superior Rajamuli movie compared to his former projects. One of the things that makes it a choice of the moviegoers is the ability to connect with the audience, making it a mass entertainer with its Elements of what we call a masala movie going experience. Ajay Devgn left a mark, short lived but a pivotal role so I am glad he made his impact in the movie. Both the leads were great in their roles and I would choose Ramcharan if I had to pick one , partially because he had a better narrative and also his acting. The production team put their work on right note and as a whole the movie worked. This movie is better than other projects that the director has been part of, both in execution and overall production value. The movie connects mostly with the audience, making it an entertainer and a enjoyable experience. Unlike his previous movies, it has less dull moments and over the top acting performances, but putting them in the context and applied when necessary. A big shout to the composer and the score; it's a treat. So, the movie works on the most part, which makes it a entertainer and a movie package to be celebrated rather than reviewed and analyzed. Bottomline is it works and the right chords are put together in this movie :
What did not work:
If I had chance, I would have worked on some technical aspect of the movie. Though better than previous movies, there were some room for improvements in editing and vfx team. Also, I would have been glad if the narratives had strong command, even more strong reasoning and motivations that guide the missions of the characters. Not saying, it's not there, but subtexts and sub layers would have made it better.Final verdict: it's a better Rajamuli project, and he has improved as a filmmaker. It does deserve a theatrical watch.",8/10,positive
smithysouravshekhar,"I am giving this film 6 stars only and only for the music. There is also no sexual scene in the movie, which is a good initiative that films can be made without sexual scenes.The reason for cutting 4 stars,

nairabh,"Finally, the most awaited movie was released today. I watched RRR (Rise, Roar, Revolt)movie made with a budget of 500 crores.It's a visual treat. S S Rajamoulis another gem of a movie after Bahubali.It is a fictional story about two Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (jnr NTR ), who fought against the British RajFull action-packed movie. Action sequences are the best directed by renowned Hollywood action director Nick Powell..
Cinematography by K senthil kumar was mind-blowing. BGM by M M keeravani was good .Overall, it was a very good movie . Ram Charan steals the show; his acting was brilliant, screen presence fight scenes, and all was top notch.Jnr NTR also supported well, and both have got equal importance in the movie.Alia Bhatt, Ajay Devgan , and samuthirakani all supported well and gave full justice to their characters played.Even the English actors were brilliant.Making of the movie is so good like camera work, fight with animals, lights and all .Technically a brilliant movie.Some scenes are so mind-blowing .I kept thinking how did the director shot that and how he thought about such scenes.This shows the brilliance of the director and his vision.1st half is mind-blowing. You will love it
2nd half is stretched, slow, but you will never be bored.It's a 3 hour long movie.Enjoy this movie in Theater only because it's a visual treat .The animal fight scenes are superb .If you get a chance to watch it in 3D you will enjoy it more for sure.After a long time, a big magnumplus blockbuster movie has come.Watch it, and it's not to be missed.I'm hoping this movie breaks all the records.Don't miss the Sholay song at the end when they show the credits..

How Rajamouli managed to rope in reputed Hollywood actor Ray Stevenson is beyond me. As for Ajay Devgun, looks like the director grabbed him right off the sets of Tanhaji but he did have a decent cameo; careful don't blink you might miss Alia in the movie. Liberal use of cheap CGI, in fact I have seen better CGI in made for TV movies. The whole premise of this 3 hour movie unravels around the kidnapping of a tribal child which I found weak definitely not in the league of Bahubali by a long shot.

The British characters are quite weird except for one of the leads, they are always angry and screaming for the smallest of things.

arungeorge13,"..and that, my friends, is how you create a visual spectacle that also manages to make us feel thoroughly invested. SS Rajamouli takes all the time in the world to let his characters get fleshed out, but every scene comes with its share of minimal-to-maximal levels of excitement and intrigue. The set-pieces are cranked all the way up, and shot in the most inventive ways possible. Rajamouli's writing is never the twisty kind, and many of the plot beats are predictable especially when you have two powerhouses (NTR Jr. And Ram Charan) in the lead, though he renders it an air of acceptability.Yeah, many filmmakers have taken cinematic liberties to alter the course of history before (Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained immediately come to mind). Yet, when someone with the imaginative capability of Rajamouli attempts it in Indian cinema, you're sure to get a product that lives up to its hype. I wasn't exactly wowed by the mythological attributes and the in-your-face imagery that swerves towards a particular kind of politics. That being said, I was easily able to look past the physics-defying stunts and over-the-top nature of the climactic set-piece as the film ultimately focuses on the fundamental notions of friendship, revolution, and freedom.P. S - It's amazing how Rajamouli even pulled off a nice little rom-com in between all the bombastic stunts.",7/10,positive
suprabhattacharya,"An extravagantly epic project in Indian cinema can only be done by a few and Rajamouli comfortably tops the list. Rajamouli knows to infuse cinematic brilliance amidst his huge larger-than-life, over-the-top storytelling. The visual glamour which he presents in his films is thoroughly satisfying and pleasing to watch.RRR is a film dipped in extreme tropes of commercialism, and still, there is a sense of realism in the characters and the events he presents throughout the film. The characters in the film are driven by typical human desires, what I mean to say you could realize every person's motive behind their actions which doesn't seem over the top rather it's how they execute their motives to achieve them is.The action set pieces are constructed extremely well, though that doesn't deny the fact that they are not logical, still, the build-up of every action sequence is infused with adrenaline rush and jaw-dropping visual splendor. The visual mastery of Rajamouli is instrumental in the epic sequences.Amidst all the visual extravaganza, there lies a simple storyline that is well balanced in three parallel screenplays. The fact that the story moves conventionally, not taking any absurd twists and turns to invoke a shock works because the nature of the film is thoroughly simplistic.The characters of Ram Charan and NTR mix well to form an exciting bromance story to screen. Both of them are fueled by opposite motivations, and that contrast adds more to their chemistry. NTR and Ram Charan of them were splendid in their roles and Rajamouli's script seems tailor-made for them.The film surely loses points in the comic scenes and takes down the watching experience a bit, but that doesn't last very long. The third act loses integrity and believability, although the visual brilliance has not left the film not for a single moment there too.The antagonists are strictly one-dimensional, though adding layers to their character was not necessary. The melodrama Rajamouli invokes in the film sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't.The scenes of both the introductions of NTR and Ram charan were splendidly constructed and executed, both scenes deserve special mention.In an epic film of the highest proportions, Rajamouli delivers what he is expected. The indelible cinematic quality of a mass film is quite rare to achieve and Rajamouli has done that quite well.",8/10,positive
210west,"Sure, ""RRR"" is over the top (in a good way), and the action sequence at the beginning, with the hero wading into a crowd of thousands in pursuit of a troublemaker, is truly amazing.But if you want a mind-blowing combination of Asian music, dancing, superheroes, slapstick comedy, comic-book violence, touching romance, and figures out of myth, I'd recommend Stephen Chow's brilliant 2004 movie ""Kung Fu Hustle."" It's half the length of ""RRR"" (which is a good thing), it never drags (as ""RRR"" does too often), its love story is sweet without being soppy, it doesn't have the rather silly homoerotic overtones of ""RRR,"" its comic sequences are funnier, its villains are less cartoonishly evil, its plot is more inventive, it doesn't turn the British into sadistic demons (since there are no British in it), and its violence isn't nearly as blood-drenched, grisly, and needlessly protracted. In short, it's superior to this one. You should check it out.",7/10,positive
KunvarAishwary,"Either portray the leads to have super human abilities and call them super heroes, or give them humanly strength and portray them only as powerful humans, but you can't and shouldn't portray super humans as normal beings and that too simultaneously. It is a mass entertainer, where heroes can do anything and no one and nothing can hurt them. The heroes can fight a mob of 1000s, can fight lions and tigers, can lift, throw and use a motorcycle with a hand, can get buffed up with one meal a week, can break open a complete hard-iron jail cell, and so on. It is another physics defying movie portraying humans as God (literally too).First half was still 6/10, but second was just a plain mob pleaser. Continuous fight sequels with dragged storyline. The whole story is: We are friends, I betray you, you betray me, I save you, you save me, we save the world.

movies_are_life_,"No doubt about it, the action scenes are inventive and fun, if a bit overdramatic. Unfortunately, scenes not involving action are made as if they were action scenes. This style of filmmaking works for some, but to me felt as if they way over the top (which is a staple of many Indian films).I do appreciate the director's intent with the filmmaking, but watching it felt like a an exercise of getting to the next action scene while having a ""meh"" feeling in between.For anyone who likes the over-dramatic style, you will find a lot to love and I urge you to watch it. For a general audience, you may check out of the movie early on and may not care how good the action is.",5/10,positive
iain-13420,This amazing movie is an absolute masterpiece in film making. The special effects are incredible but they never detract from the compelling storyline.The acting is astonishing and it's one of the very few films I would actually watch again and again. The music and choreography are phenomenal too.The two main characters strength and agility is so impressive and their skill in portraying a huge range of emotions just blew me away. Each scene must have taken ages to produce. I'm running out of superlatives here as this movie is beyond doubt the best I've seen in a long time. I'll be thinking about it and reliving it for a long time to come.,10/10,positive
ryanmo-35178,"Should be my first Bollywood movie. Used to hear a lot, dancing, overly acted, long movie. Though this one has all the above, but the plot is okay as Ram is aiming to revolt against the British, and with the help of his friend. The animal catching is quite fake but can be acceptable. The most memorable scene is one against 1000! May watch more Indian movie in the future.",9/10,positive

I've never enjoyed a movie this much !!! There was never a dull moment.I've never seen an Indian movie before this one, but man I loved every single second of it !!! Never before have I seen such a thrilling, emotional, funny, over the top, beautiful film. I fell in love with the characters immediately, and I was extremely invested in them.

MovieIQTest,"When Alison Doody was born in 1966, when she was young enough like what we saw in the related photos, wow, she's really a beauty to be desired and dreamed about. But when she played the role as Catherine Buxton in this 2022 movie, she's already 56, so like lot of the women, especially in the movie entertainment business, who rely heavily upon their looks, the only way to maintain that kind of look is injecting Botox or other plastic surgery to make them look okay without wrinkles. But cast Alison Doody to portray a British colonial woman in the 1920s era with obvious Botox and plastic surgery face, and showing that face in the very beginning of this movie, it inevitably forced me to disconnect this movie's credibility. Then the typical singing and dancing in Hindi movies further such disconnection. I have high expectation of this movie with such a high ratings, but I just couldn't watch along with these crappy singing and dancing formulas in a supposedly serious historical suspenseful movie. These same old same old formulas in Hindi movies are the reasons why Indian movies would not and could not to be take seriously. So like always, I gave it up again after 15 minutes.",,positive
jeromesgabilo,"Very rarely do I watch an Indian film and this one really blew me away! A tale of two friends from different backgrounds in colonial India was such a perfect backdrop for the marvelous storytelling of this epic drama. The cinematography was vibrant and dynamic, from simple dialogues to its entertaining dance scenes. This alone should have gotten an international acclaim from critics. The two actors' performances was an equally integral part of the film. The emotion they poured into their roles were very inspiring to the rest of the global movie industry.

mrglenngrant,"This was highly recommended on the ReelBlend podcast so had to give it a watch.I have to say that I wasn't as enamoured with it as they were.Yes, it's a great epic story that's very very loosely based on kind-of factual events ... and the characters are wonderfully hammed up by the leading actors.What I didn't like was the fact that it wasn't in it's original language - not on Netflix anyway. Even when i switched it to Hindi the lip-syncing was way off. Don't know why they wouldn't have the original audio but that was a bit crap.Some of the action pieces were fabulous ... and some were too over the top and a bit silly.A great tale though!71/100.",7/10,positive
foxmichael-60197,"This film was recommended to me. Otherwise I would never have watched it. So luckily my ears and mind was open to watching something that is well...STUPENDOUS.Even at 3 hours plus this gripping tale of violence, morals, love, dance, culture, philosophy, colonialism, hatred, - (insert another fifty or so words at random and they will apply) was entertaining in a way that realistic films are not. I would love to see this in a packed cinema in Mumbai or Delhi. I can imagine the experience would be fantastic.Of course, I watched in on netflix. But that's okay because I would not have seen it otherwise and now a new culture of film has found its way into my life. Indian film.I don't really care too much about whether it drags or if it was not the best CGI or whatever, I mean they even tell you at the beginning these are not real animals and it is all made up and the tribes don't exist...etc, so I love that. They are remind everyone ""this is a story, we made it up, sit back and enjoy the ride"". But despite the ""story"" everything is just about believable if you want it to be. And isn't that supposed to be how a film works?That you just let the film take you on a journey to somewhere you would not have gone?I watched this film and listened to some Indian music and then I wanted to dance.

info-90701,"As over the top action goes, this is up there with Tarzan and a host of the American made films. Pretty much cartoon style action adventure with incredible shots and well matched opponents.The cinematography is great, the story is not that unique, but the delivery is Bollywood on Bruce Willis of the 90's steroids. The actors are strong as they deliver an overall the top performance, and the music is interesting - perfect at times and too much at other times and like everything else, way over the top, as is the acting, to the point of comical often, but still worth it if only for the sheer nerve of it all! Of course it is as ridiculous as any war film is, since war is utterly absurd, but that is what it is. No sillier than any Rambo movie though.This film will absolutely and completely point out the abject evil of colonialism for sure, and the lostness of those who turn against their own, but that is a universal truth being told again and again in books, plays and films for centuries. It also speaks to the subterfuge of the double agent and the struggles they face. There's a lot going on in this film, but determination is the key to this story.Some of the brutality goes on too long, but apparently India is a brutal country. The cruelty with which powermonging monsters work to keep and exact that power is often astounding. Revolution is a powerful thing, and more often than not needed. This is apparent in this film. It is a tribute film to revolutionaries who fought to freedom under colonialism though I don't recognize most of the people at the end that they seem to be honoring. Still, good to know.It is well worth seeing if you like action. There is a combination of everything in this film. It is worth it for the sheer physicality of the movie if nothing else. These actors are no joke as action heroes go, and Bheem is India's McGiver! The stunts are off the chain!

I was a bit lost at times, but it all came together.And now I am spending the next hour before I go to sleep looking up the actors and learning about that final scene where they showed what I'm guessing is previous leaders from India, that whole montage. I want to get to know more about them and what they've been through. It totally sucks that England was so awful to them way back in the day. And now if you eat anywhere in London, curry is an option. There's curry everywhere. I once stayed in a hotel there and the room service had 5 different versions of curry, and that's it. No other food options.Anyway, this movie rocked.

kunalrohit-23360,"I watched this movie with a lot of expectations yesterday and got disappointed with storyline execution and unnecessary lengthy runtime. Yes, there are couple of sequences which kept me at the edge of my seat, also the background score, VFX and the brilliant acting is what the movie is all about.Moreover, certain sequences make it really difficult to understand with the scenes -1. Why Ram and Akhtar didn't dive into the river to save that child? Why did they have to go to such length when one of them could've rescued that kid (not drenched) by swimming? Though they did swim after saving the kid (soaking wet).2. After breaking into the royal palace and got caught by Ram, what happened to all those wild animals? I don't think it's wise to leave those wild animals unattended in a crowded area.3. Akhtar and Jenny couldn't communicate with eachother because of the language barrier, however before breaking Ram out of the solitary prison, Jenny explains Bheem about the layouts. How could he explain the situation to her and how can she understands and helps him with the same language barrier?4. Ram's makeover - yes, he was treated by Bheem after the prison break but how could he be wearing saffron 'dhoti'. Treating him is one thing but new clothes? How?5. Ajay Devgan' vision was to chase Britishers back to their country, however all the Ram and Bheem could do is destroy a mere building. Plot and climax doesn't align.Do watch at your own risk!",6/10,negative
umakantsharma321,RRR is a cinematic extravaganza that delivers a powerful punch of action emotion and patriotism. Directed by the visionary SS Rajamouli this epic tale of two legendary freedom fighters Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem played by Ram Charan and NT Rama Rao Jr. Is nothing short of a visual spectacle.The film takes you on a rollercoaster ride through the pre independence era seamlessly blending historical events with fictional elements.

The cgi was amazing and the whole film was just epic. I've never seen anything like it and I've watched hundreds of Indian films. This one is just special. I don't normally watch action movies.

Superhuman abilities and mortal kombat style of fight are fun and crazy a bit.The storyline is quite simple, but emotional. I won't share any spoilers here.

jcurtis-27126,"I love movies like IP man. For the action scenes are just done right. And every hit you can just see the full connection of fist and face. This movie had me glued to the screen the entire time. I love the opening scene. Even though it's a simple plot it was just done very well. Even though you may look at some of the scenes as unrealistic, it was highly entertaining and fun to watch. I also love the fact that there was no f-bombs in this movie. These are the kind of rated r movies I like to watch and I wish society would produce more of. Just the right amount of violence and Gore to be realistic and zero to no profanity that wasn't needed.In today's world and at least in america, we can't get a single solid action movie that goes all the way without having a billion f-bombs. And I get it it's a culture thing. But sometimes I feel like there's just too much of it. Especially throwing sex into everything. It was nice that this movie had zero sex and zero nudity and nothing raunchy.I got bored watching pg-13's nowadays because they're they just look unrealistic. Somebody gets their throat slit like in uncharted and there's no blood anywhere. This movie was brutal and violent but in a good way that fits. None of it was over the top. Take the movie Django unchained for example. It's a good movie but there's a lot of f-bombs the blood is over the top and there's nudity. Still a good movie. But this one just really left you with the feeling of feeling good. Your favorite character is live, the characters you hate die, and it was well put together.",10/10,positive
Dominic_25_,"I wish I could watch without a dubbed version. I wish I knew more about South Asian Independence from Britain. I wish I knew more about Hinduism. And I wish I knew anything about Indian cinema.Given how little I know about the context of this film, I was able to experience it in a way I cannot experience American or European films. Completely unbiased.I like how absurd the film is and how overacted it is. Usually those would be negatives but the point of this film is to be over-the-top and prove that it can still be enjoyable, and I think it works. None of these characters are real and none of the events are real. So the fact that nothing in this film is realistic does not matter. It is a film about the rebellion against one of the most oppressive forces in human history and it works wonders. All while being incredibly fun along the way.I will revisit this one after I familiarize myself with the context I mentioned above. I'm so glad I watched this.",9/10,positive
thethundericmanager,"RRR: The film which many Indians were waiting to be released in March 2022, released and got mostly positive reviews, but I would like to tell positive and negative aspects together.*Indian review* Read the complete review pls, no doubts would remain in your mind.Amazing Music! Very melodious, and some tracks were thrilling!Gets emotionally attached to the audience! Screenplay is greatly done!Great VFX! Very nicely done and feels very realistic, cinemaphotography
and visualization would have been tough.Hats off to the whole team!Didn't become as much good as I expected it to be, seriously I was hooked in for it, but It seriously! Honestly! Did not deliver what it promised! The trailer and the hype which is always built by everyone for a Rajamouli film was on another level, SS Rajamouli is very good director but what his speciality is, he shows something which is out of the world, his films are not fully fantasy based but, give the vibes of that genre.The Acting and the action scenes:- listen I won't straight away bash them but honestly did not like Rajamouli integrating them here, not necessary at all, in Bahubali series he was clear, great action scenes! (lifted from hollywood) were there, and yes seriously they were good.But here they are over the top! And defy physics, biology.Acting: Ram Charan did a great job, unlike his other roles, he felt very confident here and lived his role, JR Ntr in some scenes was weak, some of his expressions were childlike (while getting angry or sad) I don't how his part was messed up, because he is the one who is experienced than Ram Charan, why so? I still don't understand because he is a serious actor if we look at his other films.NO PROPER STORYLINE!STORY IS:
LOST, SAVE, REVOLT
BAM!I mean seriously? How could this be the story of a period drama film based on freedom fighters? Ok if it is fictional but this went away from bullseye!Rajamouli has given 4 Period Drama films back to back, this is not what his old films were like , he is experimenting but this would start getting boring if he makes one more with similar tone and use of similar musical instruments and notes in his films! He must deliver a different film now.Thanks for reading!",7/10,positive

cwbellor,"Have u ever watched a movie that gave you the impression the director was trying to make the greatest movie of all time? S. S. Rajamouli didn't exactly succeed with that, and that's okay. His intention was possibly not as lofty but no less ambitious. He may have sought to simply make the most delightfully over-the-top movie you've seen.A girl is kidnapped from her village by a plastic-faced British devil woman. How she managed to get work done in the pre-botox era is anyone's guess. Then we cut to the scene of a small police compound being surrounded by thousands of CGI locals. It's a scenario on par with Zulu (1964) but on the scale of World War Z (2013). Whatever the case, it's a high-anxZiety situation where we meet one half of our hero team. Raju stands guard with precision poise in a sea of chaos. But when the hostile sh** hits the fan, his stoic default setting is disabled and he goes into crowd control mode. What follows is a THWACK-BASH-POW demonstration that he is a one man wrecking ball. But of course he is passed over for promotion for not being white enough. When he takes out his frustration on a punching bag, it looks like he's auditioning for the latest DLC character to join the Street Fighter selection screen. Move over Dhalsim! While Raju likely fulfills every Chuck Norris myth ever created, he is not the only mighty manimal in this country.We are introduced to Bheem as he is playing a game of crouching body hair, smacking tiger deep in the jungle. Bheem is fierce, but he has more of a cuddly Teddy-bare-chest vibe. This will be juxtaposed nicely with Raju's suave presence and tucked in shirt.These two cross paths when they pull off a coordinated acrobatic rescue using nothing but hand gestures and enthusiasm. It creates a bond that the soundtrack insists is historical. Whether these two will become the Lennon & McCartney of ass kicking, we don't know just yet. But it's quite possibly the cutest match-up in the subcontinent. Watch and giggle as Raju helps Bheem win over the apple of his eye by pulling a Mariokart tactic. Let's just say he nails it. Then it's a Bollywood dance off that will make you sweat just watching it. We haven't even hit the halfway mark yet.A cast of thousands, gravity-defying stunts and a CGI tiger. No, it's not Army of Dead. This is RRR. It's essentially a martial arts spectacle heavy on the inspirational grand-standing while simultaneously making you laugh. Whether the heart-tugging moments are sincere and cheesy or satirical and hilarious is not clear. But when Bheem lays siege to the villain's palace by delivering the zoo, you've likely already accepted that the theatrics and melodrama are part of the package. That's to say nothing of Raju doing pull-ups in a 4x3 sweatbox utilizing nothing but a sewer grate and national pride. Hell, there's even a bit of parkour stealth during a rescue mission.My only previous Indian epic viewing was Saaho (2019) and that 3 hour macho turd doesn't hold a candle to RRR. If you can stomach the running time and the sappy dramatics, you will be rewarded with a feast of action and maybe even a few tears.",7/10,positive

JohnDeSando,"""Your friendship is more valuable than this life, brother. I'll die with pride."" Komaram Bheem (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.)Two real revolutionary fighters of 1920's India, Bheem and Raju (Ram Charan Teja), fictionally bond in friendship and battle against British colonialism. It's a long journey, over 3 hours, yet about as exciting and romantic as you could hope for in this time when Oscar contenders have strutted their stuff, and we are left with the B team.Well, not quite B in this case because RRR (Rise, Roar, Revolt in the original title) has already won the Critics Choice Award for best foreign language film, and I predict it will be a nominee for Oscar as will its catchy dance tune, Naatu Naatu.For devotees of David Lean and Quentin Tarantino, to name just a few probable influences, Tollywood productions (RRR should be called ""Tollywood"" because of the Telugu different from the usual Bollywood Hindi), this epic flight is full of romance, deceit, exotic fighting (enjoy the surprise jungle-beast package for the Brits), and espionage involving the Empire and India. A more prosaic hunt for an abducted young Indian girl frames the story.The singing and dancing, common to these lavish productions, are accompanied by uncommonly charismatic actors who make the fantasy almost real with their charming performances. Part of RRR was filmed in the Ukraine, adding heft to the pride of country and anti-colonialism themes. Although the fighting is Crouching-Tiger good, the search for love, brotherhood, and family is most definitely acceptable in a melodramatic milieu.RRR is the best of international filmmaking and a feast of cinematic excellence all in the fastest 3 hours you'll ever see.""He said that an Indian's Life is not worth a bullet. So how will this bullet earn its value? When it comes out of your gun and pierces an Englishman's heart."" RajuOn Netflix.",,positive
arthur_tafero,"This film should really have two different ratings; one for India and one for the rest of the world. I have given it a rating for the rest of the cinematic world. In India, the film would easily be an 8 or 9. Indian critics will love it. I enjoyed the film from beginning to end, and tried to attribute the obvious flaws in the film to Indian nationalism. However, most people outside of India really do not understand the history of Indian nationalism (see Gandhi, the film). Yes, the British were immoral, exploitive, and cruel colonialists; however, no picture of the English colonial period is simply black and white. Every pancake has two sides.Gandhi used passive resistance to overcome the British. In this film, the protagonists use various levels of brute force and physical rebellion. The film is obviously over the top and a satire to those in the West, but many in India would not see it as over the top or a satire. To each his own. The cinematography of RRR is spectacular; probably the front runner for the Oscar in that category. And the screenplay is devilishly clever. Thankfully, there is little Bollywood action (as in musical numbers that accompany most ambitious Indian films). Good Indian films (like The Life of Pi and Three Idiots) do not use Bollywood numbers as a crutch to gain Indian audiences; they use good writing and direction, instead. This film is in that tradition, with good writing and direction, in addition to the spectacular cinematography. Enjoy the action sequences and character development plot. Once again, I would give this film an 8 or 9, if it were for Indian distribution alone. But the film is too good to limit to India. The story of an apparent British lackey versus a traditional Indian rebel is strong enough to hold up the film, even without the political overtones.",6/10,positive

Vfx are great though, so you'll like this stupidity lol.You'll find melodrama and over patriotism in the movie yet cheesy dialogue will shoot you in the head, but you'll keep on watching and needs to give big credit to the screenplay.This rollercoaster ride will force you to think twice of your existence lol!",6/10,positive
MB-reviewer185,"This movie was fascinating. I do not usually watch movies like this, but I thought this was cool that the country of India made this movie because of how big in scale this movie is.The acting was great, and the two main characters were nice to see together. The two main characters have a nice friendship with each other and you like having them together doing things like dance battles or going up against the British together.The action scenes in the movie are nicely choreographed and they look like cooking, even though they can defy physics the way it is shot makes it look real. The dramatic scenes are effective, and you can feel the pain the characters go through throughout the movie.There are dance battles and/or only regular dance numbers that are well done, you can admire the dance choreography because of how fast they move to the music. The British in the movie is clearly shown as evil and brutal when going up against people from India, I thought this was a way for us to root for the main characters but also know what it was like being attacked by them.RRR (2022) is a movie I highly recommend that has great action, dance numbers, choreography, acting, and good music. You must find the right time to watch it because it is 3 hours and 7 minutes long, but it is worth your time.",8/10,positive
desicowboysamurai,"I was a little disappointed with the song Etthara Jenda. Because they want Hindi version to be hit, they are using imagery of Ram, but didn't showed any freedom fighter from the land of this language and the religious personality, Uttar Pradesh. They could've used an examples like Mangal Pandey, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Jawahar lal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri etc.The whole subcontinet has the influence of the culture, language, religion, classical performing arts of Uttar Pradesh but since the region is not rich and powerful currently everybody dont care about it but uses its cultural and historical exports for there useAnother director who uses the religious symbolism especially Ram and Krishna, classical performing art like kathak and hindustani music, but use them to promote other cultures and regions in india is Sanjay Leela Bhansali like in his movies about marathi, gujrati, rajasthaniOne more thing, there is a Punjabi Raj (actors, directors, producers) which is in hindi film industry which promote Punjabi language, people, songs, culture like water in Hindi movies, mainly for the last decadeeven if the movie is about Uttar Pradesh like latest example Bacchan Pandey they have so many Punjabi songs for no reasonthis Telugu film is no different they also dont care about the hindi version but uses its language, ram, and culture but not givng tribute to any freedom fighters like Mangal Pandey, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Jawahar lal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, they confirm my theory.",7/10,negative

iqbal_hamblin,"I watched this movie due to the amount of hype surrounding it and my interest was further piqued when a certain Pakistani movie overtook it at the UK box office only for RRR fans to take to social media to unequivocally conclude that it was a travesty of all-time to compare the two films, since RRR was so superior.Anyway, enough of the backstory and onto my opinion on RRR. It's a fun movie to watch but for me a one time watch only.When a films stand out points become the CGI or VFX and overshadow the story, screenplay, acting and dialogues then it stops being a watchable experience and transcends into the ridiculous.However when these effects are canned with no sense of the real then the final result is purely a reckless attempt at movie making.This for me is the crux of the matter with RRR. A film maker with a hefty budget, around £75 million, from what I can gather, is unable to use the modern techniques available to him to make action sequences that are rational as well as being riveting. To me it is nothing short of lazy pre-production thinking.Instead of making the action larger than life a good film maker would spend time on creating slightly smaller action packed scenes that not only carried realism but also managed to convey the message to the audience.As an example the introduction scene for Ram could easily have been watered down to give it some rationality and at the same time inform the audience the lengths this character would go to impress his superiors.Cut scenes added at the last minute to further the story again signals at poor planning from the makers, such as Bheems British love interest sharing a map of the prison compound with Bheem seemingly out of nowhere. Who & how did someone get the message to her?The actress that played Sita, portrayed as an ordinary villager, seemed to look a million dollars each time with immaculate clothing, hair, makeup etc when all the other villagers were shown wearing peasants attire.Too many inconsistencies like this ruined the movie for me.",3/10,positive
therealkromaxtra,"This is a superhero film that straddles fact and fiction. It tells of a villager and a sepoy who become unlikely friends, not realising that one is meant to be hunting down the other. The combat scenes are so over the top and ridiculous. The writing, particularly the western folk, is pretty awful, but the whole way along you'll be entertained. Whether it's by the fight scenes, the animal CGIs or the musical dance sequences, which don't jolt the narrative, something that can often occur in Bollywood films. Fortunately, there's just the right amount of music and silliness while also allowing the narrative to unfold in all its glory.",9/10,positive
rogier-86785,"This epic tale of two great superwarriors locked in both friendship and battle is a highly original, and very unexpected film. It's also, simply put, absolutely wild. And for that vividness alone, I think it's a must-see. I laughed, I cried rivers, but mostly I was bouncing off the walls.Total honesty, I found this long film is not an easy watch, and I looked at it in chunks, pausing sometimes for several days. The movie doesn't just mix genres, but basically throws everything together in a blender at full speed. It's is both too much ánd blends well. There's action, comedy, horrible slaughter, rom-com, genius off-the-rails dance scenes, and plenty more. That too makes it already worthwile.But it's the relationship between our two friends Bheem and Rama, put at odds by horrific colonial Englismen, that nails it. In essence, it's a love story on friendship, with two great guys trying to find a way out of trouble they didn't start: colonialism. And trouble it is, from heaps of soldiers fighting, to exploding bridges, to wild animals feasting and an imperial palace broken down... and that's just a taste.Quick fire on the rest: visual effects are sometimes good, but also a mixed bag, length is too long, the music is awesome, dialogue clichéd but fitting, not all characters are fleshed out enough, consistency is shaky but not really a problem with so much going on, the stunts are excellent and editing is topclass. Oh and the dancing... the singing...Ultimately, it attacks colonialism as much as it attacks your senses: in a very, very good, often bizarre way. And all the twists and turns between our two frenemies are unexpected and cool. So, go for it, but make sure the bag of popcorn is bigger than usual, 'cause this is a long and wild ride.You're gonna need it.",8/10,positive

The minus, lies with the VFX-laden scenes and the superhuman stunts.Watch out for Naatu Naatu and the chemistry of both leads.This film is a hoot, complete bonkers, something to enjoy on a movie night.

Hitchcoc,"For heaven's sake, don't take this film so seriously. It is so over the top as to be nearly laughable. I agree with the person who says they just about lost it at forty minutes. I had nothing to do and I hung in there. When I realized that the whole thing was fantastic I just sat back and watched the action. There is no reality to this. People are beaten, stabbed, lie bleeding, coughing up blood, and a scene later they're back in the game. But the acrobatics and the CGI are beyond anything I've seen. And for you Marvel fans, those films are just as realistic as this one is. These people have produced a unique product with a joyfulness that is infectious. The ten minute dance number after all the carnage and destruction was hilarious. It's a movie. It expresses a time when oppression dominated our world. We hope you enjoyed it, but it's a movie. Now let's sing and dance.",8/10,positive
fraser-simons,"This is such a wild ride. It's nice to see an action film that has a male friendship at its heart. I'm not sure I've really ever seen that, especially not in a blockbuster. There is so much slow motion cool vibes in this flick. Lots of running at people and punching them when doing so. However, just when you think it starts to get boring they throw something else that's wild at you. A dance off, a cage full of animals, one of which is used as a weapon to gore someone else, or kicking a motorbike so it flies up and can be used as a projectile.It's a very entertaining watch. But it's also overlong and attempts to do too much. The love story being the largest thing out of order. I get it, love bridges everything. But it actually completely disappears for half the story and suddenly returns in a very weird way. There are numerous points where it's just communication problems, despite them being able to give hand signals that perfectly coordinate intricate attacks against opponents.It does land heartfelt moments and has cool action while not being typically toxically masculine when doing so, and though I don't know much about Indian history, it looks a lot like surface level propaganda. Still a better straight up action film than most things these days, though. And a dance off. Don't forget the dance off.",7/10,positive

Bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by British officer Steve (Ray Stevenson) and his wife, Lady Scott (Alison Doody), while Rama is a British cop who tries to stop him.

The story is fairly basic and straight forward to follow. The script is brief and to the point. The dancing is incredible, I really don't like musicals but this films musical bits are very good. Another incredible thing is to watch the credits at the end, India has a large population and most of them seem to have been involved in making this film, how it all came together I have no idea.

In recent times, satire and 4th wall breaking became so popular that movies forgot that movie has a purpose to capture audience in a story. RRR was a movie which was over 3 hour long but I was immersed in it. The downside, according to many is unrealistic action sequences of this movie. I have seen 3 S. S. Rajamouli movies in total (Bahubali duology and RRR) like most people and what I understand is that this is his style of making action sequences. It IS unrealistic, but this is something that will over the years will age and will be known as his style. Just like Quentin Tarantino over exaggerated the amount of blood in Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill. It was unrealistic but it became a trademark for him. I strongly believe that over the years, we will see more of such instances in his projects and this will not stand out as alienated thing.Final verdict : It is a movie which rocked hollywood, certainly deserves a watch.",9/10,positive

I was drawn so deep into the characters, their stories and their love for each other I was glued to the screen.My only complaint and why I score a 9/10 is the sound.

vandykeu,"I watched this after Jason Pargin presented it on the podcast Gamefully Unemployed. I agree largely with their take on it. It was fun, and the total lack of cynicism/sarcasm is a refreshing difference from Hollywood films. The aims and objectives of the characters are clear, and the story makes sense. It's overall well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, and most of all it is pretty fun.It's also an interesting take on the latter effects of India's colonisation by the british. This is a topic we in the west don't see too much of, and although RRR portrays it effectively, I almost felt as if it still was a bit under-done. The history of western colonialism is brutal, and that brutality has been largely overshadowed by the Nazis, Communists, and World War 2 in general. I would like to see more films explore the full impacts of it. RRR is a step in the right direction, at least.On the other hand, the end of RRR left me feeling a bit uneasy. It hero-worships a number of people, in a way that came across as strongly nationalist. It made the film feel as if it were commissioned by the government, rather than being a piece of art meant to stand on its own. I have no qualms about a people being proud of their history and heritage, particularly after a history of being colonised. At the same time, this display left me to wonder who or what was being left out. I don't know enough about the history of India and its peoples to be able to judge it effectively, but I was left uncomfortable by it.",7/10,positive
rangeldobrev,"Absolutely most amazing and amusing Indian movie I have seen. It has so much elements in it that you probably need to see it couple of times and you will still miss some. Action, super heroes, love, fight, revolution, evil empire and devoted friends, Nazi style colonialist English, impossible stunts and all mixed up with some dancing and singing of course. The story is unwinding with elements of mystery and latin telenovela and there is almost no head bobbling (proverbial in Indian movies) through the entire movie which must have been very hard. As a negative I think the voices of some of the English guys are quite weak and out of place and CGI is artificial for some animals sometimes.",8/10,positive

buck-38805,"RRR is the biggest tribute to the failing british empire, a highly anticipated Telugu language film directed by S. S. Rajamouli, who is known for his blockbuster hits like Baahubali: The Beginning and Baahubali: The Conclusion. The movie has a star-studded cast, including Jr. NTR, Ram Charan, Alia Bhatt, and Ajay Devgn.This movie has generated a lot of buzz and excitement, not just in Telugu cinema but across the world. Yes, it's over the top, but it also reminds us of the atrocities that somehow lay forgotten and obscured by the third reich, and also makes us proud because there is good in this world.One of the major reasons for the hype around RRR is the presence of Jr. NTR and Ram Charan, two of the biggest superstars of Telugu cinema, who are coming together for the first time on-screen. Their chemistry in the trailer has already impressed audiences, and the movie delivers so much more/Another reason for the excitement around RRR is the involvement of S. S. Rajamouli, who has a proven track record of delivering blockbuster hits. His previous films, Baahubali: The Beginning and Baahubali: The Conclusion, broke several records and became some of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time.Apart from the star cast and director, the movie's storyline also has piqued the interest of the audience. Set in the pre-independence era, the film is based on the lives of two freedom fighters, Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, who fought against the British Raj and the Nizam of Hyderabad, respectively. The film promises to be a high-octane action drama that showcases the bravery and sacrifice of these two heroes.Overall, RRR has all the elements that make for a blockbuster hit in Indian cinema - a star-studded cast, an acclaimed director, a compelling storyline, and high-quality production values. The movie has generated a lot of excitement and anticipation among the audience, and it remains to be seen whether it lives up to its hype and expectations.",10/10,positive
AdityaShankar0901,"RRR is surely an entertaining movie and has a good story but nowhere close to saying ""Pride of Indian Cinema"", it is just an expensive project which turned commercially successful. The content is good but nothing special.What I do like about the film is that when S. S. R does a period film; he researches that and makes moments perfect. It feels like the audience is living in the British Raj era. But, the slow story and cliché actions ruin it.So, RRR is watchable and fun too. But lot of hero worship, over-the-top actions, and lame dance steps (especially the climax song Ettera Jenda in Telugu & Sholay in Hindi), is cringe and childish. The production values and VFX work (especially in dynamite blast scenes) are quite impressive for an Indian movie. It is a very good movie for one time watch but nothing like ""Pride of Indian Cinema""Rating:

Highly recommend for fans of superhero movies or anybody who likes a good dramatic film with action. The actors are also all excellent.

I am a decent fan of south Indian movies and I frequently watch them out of fun for their good storytelling but I never imagined them as a superhero. Some are also comparing this movie with marvel and dc movies. I must say this is not a superhero movie, though this makes a lot of sense for non Indians. Everyone in India with good taste in movies knows this is not a superhero movie and others who like it like this movie because they have this kind of taste in movies.Nice dance moves and good character buildup can be seen comparing to other south indian movies.

maitreyatamrakar,"There is nothing new in this Movie, if it is given a score it would be 2/10. 2 marks for good visual effects.Spoiler Alert-:The same old method (recipe) has been used to make it. Hero's promise (to heroine or father), Hindu-Muslim brother-brother (unity), fight for freedom from the British, save the innocent. After all these things, to add more flavor to it, showing the hero as a superhuman (without telling his powers, at least add one myth that how he has so much power), the twist of South (Tollywood) (turning the whole story up side down), too much VFX (Low quality visual effects) No scene is without VFX and loud sound is used to make it impressive. It has a lot of slow motion, (too much) if slow motion is removed then the Movie run time will be reduced by at least 30 minutes. So if you are going to watch RRR, don't go.

Rating: 8.75 out of 10Truth be told, I personally have never watched an Indian film. Surprising I know. My film repertoire consists of American, Thai, Japanese, and Korean styles. Having said that, the 2022 movie RRR directed by S. S Rajamouli is my first foray into Indian cinema. I am familiar with the term Bollywood. But, that is about it. However, I was surprised to learn during my research of this project that RRR is considered to be a Tollywood piece. This is very important to note when talking about this film because there are massive language differences. Tollywood is primarily South Indian. Meaning that the languages are primarily Telugu, Tamilm Kannada, and Malayalam. Bollywood however uses Hindi, Punjabi, Haryanvi, and Bihari.We are not here to speak on the language differences or compare and contrast Tollywood and Bollywood. Let's speak on the film RRR. It is considered a fictional period piece set sometime during the 1920's when Britain was occupying India. The main premise is when a young village child is kidnapped away from her friends, family, and loved ones by the antagonist Governor Scott Buxton and his wife Catherine. One of our main protagonists Komaram Bheem is the village protector and is tasked with not only finding the young girl Malli but bringing her back home safely. At the same time, our other protagonist Rama Raju is a deep cover British officer who joined and infiltrated their ranks from his village to find a way to acquire weapons and disperse them amongst revolutionaries to fight and rise up against the British threat. Through a freak accident both our main men risk life and limb to save a young boy from certain death and become best friends. However, little did they know that they were both on a fast track to collide with one another as their missions inadvertently clash. However, through different trials and tribulations, they are able to work together and accomplish both of their goals.Overall, the premise, plot, and pacing of this film is spaced out very well. It follows a fairly linear path and flows seamlessly. One thing of note is that roughly the first hour is cut into chapters much like a Quentin Taratino film. The way that this was presented was a stroke of genius and helped elevate the movie in regards to its story telling. Even though RRR boasts a three hour run time, it did not feel like it. The movie was able to transport me into their reality and allow me to leave my suspension of disbelief at the door. This is kind of what you have to do while watching this spectacle. Not to say that is a negative. It's just there are pretty absurd moments that happen in terms of story beats, action sequences, and choreography moments. For instance you have a the time where Rama Raju single handily quells a literal hoard of people and you also have the time where Bheem single handily takes down a feral tiger with his bare hands. Or how about the moment towards the climax of the movie where Bheem wields a freaking motorcycle with ONE HAND and uses it as a weapon!To say that RRR is an action packed smorgasbord is an understatement. The action and choreography sequences deviate away from traditional American cinema ideals and offer unique, entertaining, and stunning moments that you cannot help but to marvel at. There were multiple moments where I was shouting with glee and clapping with excitement. Sure there are minor strokes of borrowed elements from other film makers like John Wu. However, mostly everything else done offers a fresh take. To further heighten these bombastic sequences we have the soundtrack developed by M. M Keeravani. Whose original musical numbers truly were delights on the ears. Speaking of musical numbers, there were quite a few actual musical set pieces where characters sang and danced. While only one really detracted from the overall plot the others made sense and fit well within the universe.Others aspects of RRR that excelled were the visual effects, production quality, and the acting performances. Our two main characters gave very powerful and convincing performances. I found myself sympathizing with them on a deep personal level. Even the side characters did well. The only issues I had was the somewhat cartoony nature of the British opposition. I know that they are the antagonists and we are supposed to hate them. It is just their dialogue and movements were overdramatized and not believable. At the same time however, it wasn't so distracting that it can be construed as a serious negative mark against the movie. Through and through RRR felt like a cinematic epic and was thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. There are few negative criticisms I can dish out. Overall, I highly recommend RRR if you like over the top action and drama. 100% is a must watch in my book. My rating? 8.75 out of 10!",9/10,positive
pptech-96699,"*RRR* is a visually breathtaking film that masterfully combines action, emotion, and symbolism. The movie's standout action scenes are nothing short of spectacular, delivering moments that give you goosebumps. One of the most memorable sequences is the Vande Mataram scene, where the two protagonists come together in a heart-pounding rescue mission to save a child from a bridge accident. The intensity of the moment, combined with the patriotic undercurrent of the scene, makes it unforgettable.Another powerful moment is when Bheem releases tigers during a daring escape, symbolizing his unyielding spirit and connection to nature. The sheer adrenaline and raw energy of this scene add to the film's gripping pace. However, the moment that truly resonates is when Ram dons the bow and arrow of Shri Ram. This scene is not just visually striking but also deeply symbolic, representing the character's transformation and his embodiment of righteousness and courage.These action-packed sequences, combined with stellar performances and stunning visuals, elevate *RRR* to a level of cinematic brilliance that leaves a lasting impact on the audience.",10/10,positive
shreyasgopalhegdesmg,"I was not a big fan. Maybe bcz I haven't seen bahubali yet. I know I know, what you feel, but truth is truth.I have seen Eega starring Sudeep, one of rajamouli's creative kick. It was really nice.And extremely new to our niche.I had no interest to watch RRR. Why? The title of this movie never sounded good for me. I thought it would be one of the visually treating yet unsatisfying story. I felt so. It elevated after seeing the trailer. Unrealistic action, weird British set, weird contrast play of British and Indians looking somewhat funny at dancing scene glimpses I saw, and strange friendship thing in middle of all these. I decided it's going to be a blunder. And even after rrr did 1000 crore, my mind was ""it's boring for sure. Just a mass movie, hyped by Rajamouli's status"".Well I saw the movie, wait till I disclose.I loved it.The starting scenes, the entry scenes till the first meet of ram and bheem seemed too unrealistic, mass audience blunder. But then I dont even understand how it caught my attention. I tried my best to avoid it. It caught. I had heard that rajamouli can keep PPL emotionally connected till the end of his movies. I said naaah, it's only for emotional geeks, not for non-emotionally connecting guy like me.But well the characters, the story line, the witty dialogues though familiar yet convincing bcz of the innocence of character's emotions that are portrayed. It was nice experience. It was nice to see me lost in its story line. The story is at its best. It is what that held me on my seat. Or else I would have got up very very soon. I don't cherish any action, over the top scenes. Useless.The story is extremely rooted, metaphoric, relatable. It takes very less time to make the characters your friends or villains, subconsciously it happens. And that is what rajamouli can do and plays with. The story never went predictable, no. The story line, its progress, plot are really fresh. There are reasons why a character does something. It holds for every action by every single character. Characters who are villains turn heroes. Building emotion is a great challenge and in middle of it, changing it quite often with the aspect of ""perspective issue"" is even harder, and for a 3 hr movie it's a lot. Many fail to build emotion for a single character even after the end card of the movie. But this movie does it best.Maybe there's some logic issue to some action scenes but not to the story line. No logic issues to the characters, their thinking process, aim, behaviour.Very artistic piece, even after being a commercial one.Why? Has extensive amount of good artistic shots, screenplay, beautiful story telling maintaining the suspense/holding breath moments. And mainlu: metaphors. The entanglement with Mahabharat and Ramayana is universal throughout. And the metaphor of water and fire. I thought it was just another useless metaphor by him to add to all these to make it different from just mahabharat-ramayan metaphors. But no. It was shown once, not twice, neither thrice, it was rather justified. I thought he would leave that water-fire thing in middle. It fascinated me how it is taken in every aspect, action and every scene in the movie. It is shown even in many unexpected situations where it blew my mind over holding on to something like this which PPL consider insignificant. Very well justified metaphorization. And yea, bheem is from suryavamsha but has water characters, ram is from Chandravamsha but has fire characters. Very nice contrast.Only thing concerning me: why so much straight forward violence, why not artistic violence or symbolic one?The answer was, that was one of the main supporting reasons for emotions to build up on the characters. Bcz we are seeing exactly what character is experiencing in second person view/ as if we saw it happening in reality in front. That is what makes rajamouli achieve extra emotion goodness, which is not possible/ not strong enough in case of symbolic violence portrayal.",9/10,positive
Makkers1,"Where to begin?After fast forwarding what must have been at least 10 minutes of producer and studio intros the film begins in a jungle forest setting.The cooing tribal members indulge this almost cardboard actress of a woman with some ethnic culture. The girl who is applying the painting to this British white woman is then kidnapped by them.I read a newspaper article of how this film was making waves and receiving plaudits from around the world. Search me who these people are.It is a ridiculous film. Aside from a promising start in the jungle it descend into a humiliating and terribly unfunny farce.Get this. An Indian army officer jumps into a crowd of thousands of protesters in an attempt to arrest someone. He has a rock smashed on his head, sustains all manner of attack with sticks, punches etc but manages to maintain an igloo like space underneath all the people who jumped him. The army officer, contradicting all laws of physics, plausibility and good cinema is successful in capturing his man within a sea of 20,000 people. Ha ha ha.The rest what followed of the film was an insult to my tastes and senses. After fast forwarding to catch other rare insightful attempts to raise the bar of world cinema I concluded this film not only wasted 15 minutes of my life but the TV used electricity and drained my remote of some battery power.Burn this film.

hectordanielbuelna,"Two guys bond together and join forces to beat British occupation through dancing and the power of friendship.I've enjoyed a lot of Indian movies through the years and this is by far the best one of them all. It just clicked with me. I even enjoyed the musical and dancing numbers, they striked a great balance with this. You get invested in both protagonists and their stories. Both leads are grrat actors with great physicality, Bheem has many scenes where you can see his flaws but also great emotional scenes where you can see his potential and Raju is just on point the entire movie, when the twist finally comes I felt as baffled as Bheem wondering how could he betray his bro.This movie is not for everyone but I like that international filmakers can still surprise us with these great, action pack films.",9/10,positive
kelvinselimor,"RRR. One goal, different destinies. The film ""RRR"" is a grand Indian epic that amazes the viewer with the grandeur of the production and emotional depth. Director S. S. Rajamouli has created a large-scale canvas where the dramatic destinies of two heroes, Alluri Sita Rama Raju and Komaram Bheem, intertwine. Their paths intersect in the history of the struggle for Indian freedom.The plot captivates the viewer from the very first frame, offering exciting action scenes, fast-paced battle scenes and touching moments of friendship and devotion. Superb cinematography and stunning visuals make ""RRR"" a real spectacle. The soundtrack of the film is a separate work of art, complementing the dramatic tension and emotional intensity of the film.The combination of historical context and fictional elements creates a unique atmosphere. The acting of Ram Charan and N. T. Rama Rao Jr. Impresses with his sincerity and power, making the viewer feel every emotion along with them. RRR is a triumph of cinema that shows the power of friendship, the quest for freedom and the unwavering spirit of humanity.",10/10,positive

The Dances are extraordinary.Dont know why Rajamouli had cast Alia Bhatt not much screen space and role it's like taking Bunrah in your cricket team and not giving him bowling.The music seems to be same as Bahubali songs.After watching Bahubali 1 & 2 I was expecting Dir. Raja Mouli will be a challenge to Dir Spielberg and will be taking Indian Cinema to next level in World stage.I was expecting a far better creation from Rajamouli.The movie is good apart from lacking logic and conviction. Not able to get involved or get connected with the character like Bahubali.

Let's not get ahead of ourselves by terming RRR movie as Pride of Indian Cinema or on par with Hollywood movies. Nothing new achieved in this one apart from the wide release. Our people have saw Hollywood movies... So lets get there and then talk abt it.Mr. Rajamouli Simply felt looted after watching the movie with so much expectation and buzz created. Stop it.

Alia bhat's performance is average and can be said the role was not required either. Ajay Devgan's bold voice is thrilling though. Climax and VFX are superb too.Naacho Naaacho song and the energy expected from movie stays within the song length only. Raja should be not tried to extend the movie length to that extent.

guisreis,"Nice buddy action film (in the border between rivalry and soul friedship) from Bollywood on anti-colonial struggle. While the two leading characters are inspired in two real-life anti-colonial heroes, and also in mythological epics (Ramayna's Rama and Mahabharata's Bhima), their stories are completely fictionalized in the movie, including their relationship. Alluri Sitaram Raju (or A. Rama Raju, or simply Ram) never met Komaram Bheem (and I am not sure if he has ever served military official forces either). On the great merits of the acclaimed flick, I may say fight coreographies are impressive (often in Mission:Impossible-style scenes), art direction is beautiful, political background is important. The small romantic comedy part is amusing too (romance between Bheem and Jenny, not between him and Raju, to be clear). The dance duel, very Bollywoodish, was also well performed. Torture scenes are heavy, although very stylized. There are, however, some serious flaws not often mentioned: extremely and unreasonaly cheesy edition many times, there is a fragrant continuity mistake (Raju's horse is changed in the same scene: a horse with two white hoofs for one with four dark hoofs), and the sudden recovery from a deadly poison effect immediately after having an information is ridiculous even for this hightened reality universe logic. By the way, I read a critic saying that the characters were too one-dimentional, but I think it missed the point: while Bheem is indeed very heroic and loyal throughout the story, Raju's moves continuously, from loyalty to deception, from dire cruelty to self-sacrifice, from selfish ambition to idealism. Among the British colonists, as a matter of fact, they were all but Jenny quite evil, but... come on, people shall stop presenting colonial rule as something more reasonable than fascist expansion before and during World War II or than military dictatorships in Latin America. The level of violent cowardice and dehumanization was similar. Colonial rule was evil indeed, just as fascism and military dictatorships. In an action movie with impossible feats, nearly (?) super-hero deeds, where everything is exaggerated, why the hell precisely the arrogant, ruthless, racist and greedy colonists should be more realistic characters?",8/10,negative

talent-28130,"As someone who once dismissed Bollywood as a ""second-class"" Hollywood, my cinematic journey has been nothing short of revelatory. The film that shattered my preconceived notions was none other than the epic action-drama, R. R. R (Rise Roar Revolt). This Telugu-language masterpiece, directed by S. S. Rajamouli, is a testament to the fact that Bollywood is not just a shadow of Hollywood but a brilliant sun that shines on its own merits.R. R. R is a historical fantasy that weaves a tale around two real-life Indian revolutionaries, Komaram Bheem and Alluri Sitarama Raju, portrayed by N. T. Rama Rao Jr. And Ram Charan respectively1. The film's special effects are not just good; they are groundbreaking, surpassing many Hollywood blockbusters. The action sequences are a choreographed ballet of intensity and precision, and the visual effects are a spectacle that demands to be seen2.The movie's narrative is a gripping, high-octane ride that defies gravity and expectations alike. It's a visual spectacle, with world-class VFX and sets that are mounted on a colossal canvas2. The dance numbers are not mere interludes but integral parts of the storytelling, blending seamlessly with the film's fabric.For those who might be hesitant, let me be clear: R. R. R is not your typical Bollywood fare. It transcends the tropes and clichés that many associate with Indian cinema. It's a film that showcases the best of what Bollywood can offer - a feast of entertainment that's both intoxicatingly over-the-top and deeply rooted in quality cinema3.So, if you've been wary of Bollywood, let R. R. R be your gateway to a world of untapped cinematic excellence. Excuse me while I go catch up on some more ""Bollywood"" because, with films like R. R. R, it's clear that I have been missing out on some truly quality cinema.",9/10,positive
anubrata-03180,"I watched RRR (Rise, Roar, Revolt)movie made with a budget of 500 crores.It's a visual treat. S S Rajamoulis another gem of a movie after Bahubali.It is a fictional story about two Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (jnr NTR ), who fought against the British RajFull action-packed movie. Action sequences are the best directed by renowned Hollywood action director Nick Powell..
Cinematography by K senthil kumar was mind-blowing. BGM by M M keeravani was good .Overall, it was a very good movie . Ram Charan steals the show; his acting was brilliant, screen presence fight scenes, and all was top notch.Jnr NTR also supported well, and both have got equal importance in the movie.Alia Bhatt, Ajay Devgan , and samuthirakani all supported well and gave full justice to their characters played.Even the English actors were brilliant.Making of the movie is so good like camera work, fight with animals, lights and all .Technically a brilliant movie.Some scenes are so mind-blowing .I kept thinking how did the director shot that and how he thought about such scenes.This shows the brilliance of the director and his vision.1st half is mind-blowing. You will love it
2nd half is stretched, slow, but you will never be bored.It's a 3 hour long movie.Enjoy this movie in Theater only because it's a visual treat .The animal fight scenes are superb .If you get a chance to watch it in 3D you will enjoy it more for sure.After a long time, a big magnumplus blockbuster movie has come.Watch it, and it's not to be missed.I'm hoping this movie breaks all the records.Don't miss the Sholay song at the end when they show the credits..

Militaristic nationalism and the over-the-top absurdity meet a VFX budget that would be more in step with a Sci-Fi steraming series. Not that i didn't have fun watching, but the politics was so obvious that it took me out of the campy enjoyment.A tale we'll told but not one that I share many values with. The dance battle with the white guys being put to shame was a highlite. The slow mo animal release at the big party was iconic and I haven't see such longing gazed between two male characters since I canceled my Menatplay account.

Put the sub-titles on to appreciate the songs even more since the words directly tie into the emotions of the moments on screen.The two main protagonists even though so difference in character and motivation...the one for revenge ...the other for love are so well matched when put together.You feel the pain so badly when ""betrayals"" occur...but are again elated when these two join up again...the unstoppable force and the immovable object acting as one.The final escape scene from the jail had us rolling on the floor with laughter.Some great special effects are also on show here.... I shudder to think what this production must have cost...I hope they made their investment back 10 fold.Give this show a miss if you are unable to suspend disbelief for 3 hours of great fun...or if you are averse to Alpha male toxicity.

Their meeting, confrontational scenes together are completely new and exciting for the audience. It is needless to say how Rajamouli makes his actors look well built, but the emotions and the body language are so well given by the actors.NTR already proved himself as a great performer many a time earlier. But RRR gives us a chance to witness a new dimension in him. NTR entertains us in a rugged role this time and he is flawless in it. Right from the introduction scene till the end, NTR keeps the intensity bar up and above. NTR is at his best in Komuram Bheemudo song than any other.Ram Charan evolved as one of the best performers with RRR. He looks tack sharp and keen in every frame. Ram Charan amazes us with his selfish tough man nature at one point, while he equally surprises us by telling his inside thoughts with his subtle performance at the other. He so blends in the role of Rama Raju, that we get to adore him more after RRR.Alia Bhatt made her presence felt in a graceful manner. She looked beautiful in traditional attire and emoted well in important scenes showcasing her talent. Olivia Morris got a good role and she looked gorgeous and expressed well in all her scenes Ajay Devgn performed well in the action-packed role. Shriya is ok in the role of Ajay Devgn's wife. Rahul Ramakrishna played an important role. Samuthirakhani did his job as the subordinate of Ram Charan.Ray Stevenson and Alison Doody appear as Scot Duxton and Catherine Duxton respectively.

dgrv75,"What an experience!As a movie, as a pure emotional experience, this is easily a 9. Great ideas, wonderful craziness, amazing characters and songs.As a story, it's the best religious conservative nationalistic propaganda I've ever seen. Incredibly entertaining, smart, but also the fuel that leads to wars, genocides and hatred.It might not always be evident, but being a lover of both history and cinema, this was what I was thinking while watching the movie: how much of an improvement this is compared to Soviet or Nazi propaganda.I strongly recommend watching this movie. To be entertained. But also to practice media analysis. It's a great subject.Don't be fooled though. This is the kind of ideology that has one single authoritarian and normative vision for all, and as the last song says, « no one will dare attack us » (I'm paraphrasing). Or in other words: anyone who is not with us is against us.

Effects with the wild animals were top. I don't know what to say more, really. But I do recommend it to everybody. I though for a while that those action sequences are little bit over. But then I realized it's not more than you get in all those Marvel and DC superheroes movies. But RRR was way more exciting to watch.",9/10,positive

isuryanarayan,Just watched RRR in Hindi Language . Charcter introduction is outstanding . Background music by M kreem was superb . Screenplay was outstanding . Action and slow motion fight were beautiful . As we know this movie is directed by our famous SS Rajamouli who gave direction very beautifully . Ram Charan & Jr. NTR performance are Top Notch . I think Ram gave best performance after Magdheera . Both actor dubbed this movie in Hindi language which I really enjoyed .Although Ajay Devgan & Alia character were very small but peresence was very awesome for this movie . I really Liked .,9/10,positive
ms-89744,"The movie was good in some areas and worst in some.Good ones:
1) The acting of both the leads and other supporting characters
2) The storyline upto some extent(70%)
3) Songs
4) Specific scenes( eg- entry scene- fire one)
Bad ones:
1) Worst action which looks totally fake. Rajamouli is a clown who uses CG and VFX to make unrealistic actions which pulls you out of the movie and it looks comedy then.2) No realism except at some portion.3) Quick wrapup with unreal twists such as ram wife came suddenly and met bheema to tell the back story, likewise.As rajamouli has 30% profit stake in the movie. He went to each and every platform to promote the movie which is ridiculous as after making such movie , going like beggar to get the promotion. Really worst thing he did like a keech. He just sticks his nose everywhere. Worst director..totally worst.Overally, the movie can be seen because of the story and lead roles acting but be ready to have some fake CG things and fake actions in between. Rest, the story will keep you most of the time except the portion where fake unrealistic actions or CG things come.P. S. CG is computer graphics.If you have sufficient time go for it, it is above average. If don't have time, you will not miss anything special.",6/10,negative
drparth,"Story is superweak. Too much VFX effects and unnecessary loud background score. You need to rest your brain away for 3 hrs to tolerate this movie. I'd have given negative ratings if possible.Can I demand refund of money and claim for the time wasted?Those who are comparing and think that this is better than a hollywood action movies - please start watching hollywood movies.@ S. S. Rajamauli - I had real expectations from you but you disappointed. If movies would be great only based on VFX and background scores, then you would win Oscar but its not reality. Movies work for their stories, stories which can touch the people and connect. Please consider making cartoon movies now with all the effects that you are using.From me, ZERO or NEGATIVE RATINGS.",1/10,positive
ActorDevGill,"Superb movie by SS Rajamouli Sir. Unique storyline that dates back to pre-independence era and draws the viewers into the inspiring lives of freedom fighters played by Junior NTR and Ramcharan.The emotions and sentiments of the characters are beautifully depicted. Great action sequences filled with explosive , thundering scenes that will have everyone jump in their seats.Music by MM Keerwani is epic and has won the OSCAR for his song Naatu-Naatu that has made the whole world take notice of Indian films and the richness of Indian music. The song is definitely a game-changer for India and has great choreography too.Wonderful performances by both accomplished superstars NTR and Ramcharan. Lovely cameos by Alia Bhatt and Ajay Devgan whose presence has rendered a pan-India feel to the film.Locations, costumes, choreography, cinematography, editing are all top notch. An absolute entertainer from SS Rajamouli.",9/10,positive
DatBrownCat,"RRR is easily one of the most entertaining action movies worldwide. Outstanding acting, casting, cinematography, effects, editing, and direction (although the British were probably made to look far more sinister than they may have actually been in suppressing India's independence in the 1920's). An Indian police officer seeking to become a hero in British eyes for reasons which take some time to emerge and a tribal super warrior willing to risk everything to rescue a young girl kidnapped from his tribe by the British governor's wife, form the best hero duo. Excellent action scenes and definitely worth a watch.",9/10,positive

pvyczyn,"It may be 3 hrs long but it was 3 hrs not wasted. Well, done! It does make our American movies suck after watching this one. I also love that it wasn't a gory movie. Yes, it has violence but it really had a story to tell. It's also romance, masculinity, military might vs towns people/ villages, family, just a wholesale and a unification communities. It has its ugliness of cruelty. But the human or focus in strength and conviction is very, powerful. It also had the best theatrical and amusing scenes including the fight scenes that just keeps you watching. What's next! I just love it is like a folk lore come true type story. The Real Gods! The real heroes! Saving the day! The music and dancing.- and the ending! Excellent performances! I can't say enuf about this movie but to me it's a 10! It has just about everything in a movie and the special moments and wonderful acting. Makes this 3 hour movie worth a watch! It will be a memorable movie!!Rest in glory Ray Stevenson. You were one of my favorite actors to watch.I kept saying throughout this movie. Wow! How can you beat that! Lol. And loved the ""Love at first sight.""My other thoughts are as I was watching. You didn't have to be sexual by undressing women and just no real gory scenes from the violence. And it's true to that era.At the beginning. You are just dumbfounded by the courage one man does for his cause. It's just CRAZINESS!!",10/10,positive
ayaanbhojani,"Gave it a watch and RRR is a great film showing emotions and the storyline showcasing the British ruling over the country. Jr NTR does a really good job and acts amazingly with his expressions,Ram Charan also acts well and does a good job though i felt he ws a bit over with action in some scenes,Thr is a British actress in the film who does a really good job and acts vry decently,The special appereances by Ajay Devgan and Alia Bhatt are attention catching and thy do a decent job as well. Talking about the negatives, the film is over Lengthy and cld be easily trimmed fr 15-20 minutes and another is also weak hindi dubbing a bit of the actors.

kosmasp,"And I really mean that. Whether in good or bad - whether in highs or lows - this movie has it kind of all. There are so many cliches here, it should make you dizzy. It is predictable when it comes to the story but also the good and bad guys in this. I mean the bad guys are so over the top it might hurt.So why is my rating so good you may ask? It is because the movie is quite the looker! The visuals is as awesome as it can be. The stunts and the CGI work - many times involving animals too. You can tell the animals are fake (the foreword including the not wanting to offend anyone was actually not necessary, but I guess they wanted to be safe, not to hurt anyones feelings), but it doesn't matter. Because it still looks awesome. And there are plenty of scenes involving animals where you literally will go ""wow"" .. or ""whoa"" ... or whatever other noise you are making.Stunt/fight choreography is off the charts ... giving the main characters almost super human strength. Actually not almost, but certainly - also add ""abilities"" to it, that are just not realistic in any sense of that word. Su suspending ones disbelief is part of the deal - it is actually a must! Even if it may a bit too long for my liking too ...",9/10,positive

SoumikBanerjee1996,"S. S. Rajamouli, sir, hats off! You've done it again.If I were, to sum up, ""R (Rise) R (Roar) R (Revolt)"" is majestic, in the truest sense of the word. All those mainstream movie lovers, where are you at? Come and take a look, you got the peak of commercial cinema here, and that's not even an exaggeration! With scintillating imageries, stupendous sets, and a phenomenally mastered composition (one of the best sound designs my ears have experienced); Rajamouli's 'brainchild' is cut above the rest.Now I know some of you may come up with some objections regarding the film's quite outrageous, and melodramatic approach, while you are right from your viewpoint, the movie does have some of those ridiculous, over-the-top stints, yet, the apt guidance from Rajamouli and his innate sense of world-building more than make up for the notable peculiarities. I would go as far as to say, his style of presentation makes the entire set-up believable and almost convinces us with the very notion that these characters (Ram & Bheem) are superhuman
and they indeed possess superhuman strengths.Their amazing performances make their case even stronger. Both Ram Charan and Jr. NTR were exceptionally good in their respective roles. Their camaraderie, their alliance, the bromance, and the chemistry between them are what sealed the deal for me. While Jr. NTR does what he does best, and he's honestly great at it but it's rather Ram Charan who mesmerizes. Speaking for myself, this is his best work to date. There are some well-touted cameo appearances from Ajay Devgan and Alia Bhatt as well. While the former had been given a meaningful part to play, the latter endured less importance and even lesser screen presence. That's probably my only complaint to Rajamouli for not taking advantage of Alia's highly regarded acting prowess. In other respects, he outdid himself once again!",9/10,positive
sodiumtt,"This film is true epic like Lord of the Rings or the Godfather trilogy. I was gripped from beginning to end and didn't feel like it was 3 hours long. The direction is great and the production matches it. The acting is great, especially the lead characters. The overall story was great and the smaller cut away story's fired in seamlessly. This film made me laugh, shocked me, made me cry and made me ashamed of my country's past. I wish I'd seen this on the big screen.I wasnt able to see the the original language version so I watched it originally in Hindi and then the English Dub. There's quite a difference between the English dub and the subtitles and imo the script used in the English dub was better than the subtitles.",10/10,positive

Its focus on a bromance al makes it ten times better.However, some of the dialogue is very blunt and direct, and the editing can be fast and confusing.The length makes it feel bloated and like it could have ended way sooner, but by the end of it, I doubt you would care.This movie has so much to enjoy in it that the flaws are at the very least not that memorable.",7/10,positive

SnoopyStyle,"In colonial India, the Governor is on a hunting trip and his wife buys a little girl. The villagers thought that the mother was being paid for her singing. The tribe's protector Komaram Bheem sets off on an unrelenting quest to retrieve the girl. The Governor orders his capture although they have little information on the mysterious rescuer. Skilled ambitious colonial police officer Alluri Sitarama Raju intends to infiltrate the revolutionaries and capture him for an important promotion.I don't do a lot of Bollywood. I do have an issue with musicals being injected into every genre of film. Some fit better than others. For this movie, I feel that it elongates a movie that is already rather lengthy. I do really like the two main characters. I expected a Braveheart-like story. Raju's backstory turns out to be very different than expected which leads to a lengthy final act. As for the action, it is big. It is broad. It has a lot of Zack Snyder slow-motion flair, for good and for ill. I do appreciate this as a nationalistic crowd-pleaser modern epic for India.

lucastrabjerg,"The good:Plot and story arc(s) - This movie has one of the best and most well-written plots i have seen in a very long time. It is seperated in 2 plots that combines perfectly, and they are filled to the brim with twists and forshadowing. The movie is also very well paced despite its long playtime.Action - The action squenses are very well made and have you sitting on the edge of your seat, and they come jsut before boredome kicks in.Characters - There are a bunch of characters, and almost all of them are thought through and have some part in the story, whether it's small or big.The not so good:CGI - It's easy to say that the CGI definetily could have been much better. All animals and some of the big vehicles were fully computer-generated, and becouse of the somewhat low budget of the film, it did not turn out well.Acting - The acting wasn't all bad. Most of the main characters had very good actors and was performed very well, but many of the smaller side characters came across as cringe, corny, over dramatic and awkward in most of their scenes and lines.Unnecessary parts - The movie was filled with dances and unnecessary songs that only distracted from the rest of the scene and story. I know this is becouse it is an Indian film and it's part of their culture, but i still think it would be better off without those things.Over-dramatic and unrealistic - There was a bunch of far too unrealistic, over-dramatized and absurd scenes and moments. Ofcourse unrealistik scenes and plots can be very good, for example in superhero and space movies. But there is a difference between unrealism in a unrealistik universe, and unrealism in a realistik universe, and this movie is the latter. It is supposed to be a movie set in the real world with normal human characters, but their feats don't come close to what we see in real life, and therefor it feels kind of goofy.Too long - I'm not saying the movie is slow, in fact, as i mentioned above, i think it is very well paced, but it is simply too long. It's so long that it is hard to watch all the way through despite the good pacing. It could easily have been 2.5 hours if they had left out some of the unnecesarry parts.Conclusion:All in all this is a really great movie. You can definetily feel throughout the movie that it is a so called 'Bollywood' movie, with its over-dramatic, unrealistic scenes and endless songs and dances, but the good things in it easily makes up for it and creates a very exciting and well written film that has you on the edge of your seat for almost all 3 hours with an interesting plot and good action.The not so good things mentioned above can sometimes distract one from the film's otherwise well-written plot, and break the flow of the story, but it's not a deal-breaker. I know that the dance scenes, songs, over-dramatization and unrealistik feats are what symbolises a 'Bollywood' film and makes it what it is, but i simply don't care. Without them, the movie whould easily be a 8/10 or maybe even a 9/10.",7/10,positive

The two leads connecting lines were also done well.The exceptions that I mentioned above were showing the leads as super heroes with godly powers. Any human being can't have such super powers to recover from bad injuries in a few hours. This is pure common sense. Its hard to believe that a movie this long could not figure out ways to bring it close to reality. Making movies for international audience has it's challenges and if anyone can do it that's Rajamouli. It was disappointing to see that he missed these basic things. When the story line is about 2 normal human beings with above average abilities, then the characters should align with that story line seemlessly. This movie is a must watch with the few reservations that I mentioned. Some scenes, like saving the kid from the water, crashing into the palace, hanging, arresting the freedom fighter etc etc were all exceptional and highly entertaining.",7/10,positive

All the actors have done a wonderful job. RamCharan and Jr NTR have portrayed their roles with such power and style. Not to forget Alia, who brings so much elegance to the movie.

vipbhatt-40905,"This is my personal opinion and solely mine only.Many normal Bollywood enjoy-er will not agree with my opinion.After watching this movie, I came across with one question. That is ""Why on earth would someone shame our gods, our culture and our history"".To start off my review I would like you all to know this film is highly historically inaccurate and is also imaginary. Imaginary in a childish way.Why I say that? Because of the storytelling and cinematography. They're absurd! They've promised to bring back the magic of Indian Cinema on screen but instead they've took the cringe to whole another level.They've screwed physics on another level this time, much worse then Bahubali 1 and 2 part combined. For instance they've made a bike look like its nothing but a light stick.They've screwed with biology too, they've made a tiger look bigger than Liger and Panthera Leo, and a fox as almost as bigger as a modern day rhino.Coming to the scenes/montages of this films they're sometimes so fast paced and sometimes you will feel like how can I forward this?For instance the opening shot is so irritatingly fast that a you will still process it until you see the Jr. NTR.They don't explain how time is going in this movie which is very very bad story telling and illogical. A story teller even if he's telling a story he must be honest to his story and respect nature of time at least.The bond between NTR and Ram Charan almost feels like Homo Romance (#Pride) trust me they've done it horribly wrong.Now coming to the part that pisses me the most. That is really not respecting my country and Hindu god.Now when you see Ram he becomes Lord Rama in last part of the movie which irritates me more than enough because Lord Rama is god and not a ghost to posses him (if we think really deeply, you will get my point here).And this is not a respectful tribute to my country's history as its not honest in all the possible ways. You see India is a country that has been through a lot! That have given birth to many many freedom fighters that didn't had the luxury to run away from the punishments of British.They've escaped Britishers multiple times which makes Brits incompetent and stupid, which they were not. They were really horrible back in the days. They didn't show how racism was they just made party videos and showcased unrealistic patriotism throughout the film honestly.Coming to point many honest and patriotic people will relate to. India a country that has documented history older than word ""History"" itself. We have so many extra ordinary real life stories to tell and make the new generation know that what people have really done for freedom!!There are stories of so many kings who disobeyed British empire, fought bravely till last soldiers. Freedom fighters whose voice was crushed before they could speak. Humanitarians whose decisions made us who we are today (For example Mr. Jamsetji Tata
and so many more) so many many more stories so many legends so many honest and true stories which both actors could relate and play.Almost everyone performed exceptionally well! However I just hope bollywood could get into a new direction and use its talent honestly. They're only making cringe movies making our audiences taste bad and putting history to shame.This movie is hilarious and makes no logical sense. If this kind of budget was used to produce Indie films OMG they'd had done more research than Mr SS Rajamaouli and his entire team would have ever done and come across with some exceptionally well movies in this genre.I still wish we have more movies based on colonial age because people need to be educated for this time.I hope you will get my point. This movie is absurd but watch it and decide for yourself. You may like it too.",2/10,positive

madanmarwah,"This is the quintessential folklore based musical extravaganza which SS Rajmouli specialises in and which provides an extended 3 hour plus entertainment with larger than life characters, action, sets, special effects etc. You get the drift ? So you need to settle down with your popcorn, take off your shoes/ slippers, send your grey cells on a holiday and enjoy watching the movie. (Seeing this over the top gravity defying action prompted one of the reviewers to ask if SS Rajmouli had failed in Physics !)
The plot is a fictitious one about two legendary revolutionaries who fought against British colonialists in 1920s and how their friendship stood the test of the tough times and the tumultuous events. But the movie's central focus is not only on the story but on the massive scale of its picturisation which is designed to dazzle and mesmerize you with one grand scene following another. There are extended scenes of fights between the natives and the Brits. There are aerial shots of mobs in huge numbers, you have wild animals let loose on the British soldiers, a burning motorcycle hurled into a building, buildings on fire etc. There are a couple of astounding climaxes since a plot having such a wide canvas cannot have just one. To balance the high decibel action, there is also an adequate amount of sentiment and melodrama in some scenes. Among the two protagonists, one is called Ram ( Ram Charan)and his fiance is Sita ( Alia Bhatt). The other main character is Bheem ( NTR JR ). Rajmouli sir is back at doing what he does best. This man does everything on a grand scale and easily goes overboard doing it. He is a visionary among film makers. Both NTR JR and Ram Charan have put all their energy into their acting and will no doubt immensely please their fans. Ajay Devgn and Shraddha Kapoor have small though impressive roles. Interesting to see them playing Telugu characters.",7/10,positive

natureboy-84907,"It was a race mixed with luck in booking tickets for this movie in PVR/SPI cinemas for the first day shows. Everyone by default walks inside movie hall with the mindset of movie to be Stupendous and that's the power and success of Rajamouli . RM never misses to ensure seeding that BIG PICTURE thought in everyone's mind even before his movie release . He has a clear and flawless plan on how to target and spend producers every single penny and return them with huge profits. Back to the movie , only our expectations were sky high but not Rajamouli's . Be it the screenplay, storyline or the visuals everything were pretty ordinary and sometimes overkill. CGI in many places especially in the first half were so unreal and not in par with Baahubali . In particular to the animals recreated through CGI. The performance of both RamCharan and Jr. NTR were remarkable and they were the biggest strength of the movie . Agreed that they are muscled but can't agree that they can fight against 1000s single handedly and come alive . Too much overdoing in many of the scenes including stunts that were beyond exaggeration . .The first half of the movie was full of unbelievable things and probably RM thought we would accept anything and everything when it's from him . That way it's time for him to do away with such thoughts . Naatu Naatu song was completely power packed and good choice of actors to play as English . Olivia as Jenny performed so well and same is the case with the actors as Scott and Mrs Scott. The second half of the movie was terrific and definitely on fire. Hardly any stupid CGI, excellent work by Art directors . The stunt scenes were really enjoyable and the pace of the second part was making us forget the flaws in the first half . Short and sweet contribution by Ajay Devgan , Shriya Saran, Aaliyah Bhatt, Samuthrakani and many more . Great 3D work in some of the scenes , must note . The music and BGM by Keeravani reminded lot on Bahubali . That way even certain scenes and instances in the movie were having lots of shade of Baahubali . May be Rajamouli was running short of creativity. Another couple of movies this way , he might get lost in the crowd. The hype was directly proportional to the cost of the movie . RRR is a mix of bad and good like that of my review. It is more of a fantasy than reality with a must watch second half. Overall RRR the movie Rumbles, Rises and Roars !",7/10,positive

As an audience, I am not able to overlook this factor and give the movie anything greater than 6 stars.Now that we have the negative out of the way, let's talk about the positives. Background score and the songs are pure gold and I am proud as an Indian for the accolades it amassed. What steals the show is the friendship of the 2 protagonists. The lengths they go for each other makes one ask if the brilliant director Rajamouli disguised the first gay couple in a mass movie under layers of action and bravado. The way the 2 steal glances of each other, touch and yearn for each other is nothing short of pure love. Its not practical to announce it in a period piece, hats off to the radical execution pulled off by Rajamouli and our heroes.

BA_Harrison,"N. T. Rama Rao Jr. Plays tribalist Komaram Bheem, who embarks on a mission to rescue Malli, the girl abducted from his village by wicked British governor Scott Buxton (Ray Stevenson) and his cruel wife Catherine (Alison Doody). Ram Charan Teja is dashing police officer Alluri Sitarama Raju, whose job it is to apprehend Bheem. When the men meet, not knowing each other's purpose, they become friends, but friendship inevitably turns to violence in order for them to complete their missions.With impossibly strong heroes who can withstand intense pain and brutality, outrageous action sequences that make the Fast & Furious films seem realistic by comparison, a total absence of historical accuracy, more slow motion than a dozen John Woo movies, a whole menagerie of unconvincing CGI animals, and ridiculously vile villains, this is a film that requires the viewer to suspend disbelief and just go with the flow. If you can do that, then the film should prove thoroughly entertaining for the duration (over three hours): it's directed with panache by S. S. Rajamouli, the cinematography is stunning, the pace is brisk, the fight scenes are bone-crushingly violent, and while patently ridiculous, the story is engaging.8/10.

scaryjase-06161,"I've heard this is good, but there would have been absolutely no chance of me watching it under normal circumstances - I'm expecting it to be somewhat outside of my cultural norms.Well, yes it is but it is, in places at least, a load of fun. It is also, in other places, overblown, silly, impressive, you-name-it - basically, any adjective you can think of will probably be covered at some point during the 182 minute running time. But what it is throughout is utterly, utterly bonkers.The general plot, as The Guardian states, follows a pair of real-life revolutionaries - Komaram Bheem (played by N. T. Rama Rao Jr) and Rama Raju (played by Ram Charan). What The Guardian or the film neglects to mention is that, in real life, the two of them never met so this is all completely invented. And if they had met, you can be quite certain that it wouldn't have gone anything like it does here - the whole thing features so many twists, turns and coincidences as to be quite ridiculous. And that's even before we get to the singing and dancing!The main baddies in this are very much the British and they are all amusingly pantomime (except for Jenny, who is pure of heart and helps them in their hour of need). There are also times when both of the ""heroes"" indulge in some extremely unheroic behaviour - at times they are actively working against each other (but obviously things get resolved before the end and they come together to beat those awful Brits).The film may be utterly ridiculous, but it certainly doesn't lack ambition. It has some very impressive imagery and stunts, a HUGE cast of extras (the introductory scene apparently featured 10,000 people) and some very impressive sets indeed - it's always a feast for the eyes. And although the plot is ridiculous, it is engaging - you know perfectly well how it's going to end but you're interested to see how it gets there (whilst often not believing what you're seeing).Assuming that everyone in this film was told to go completely over the top, the acting is very much as the director wanted it. NTR Jr and Ram Charan are both engaging (and apparently very big things in the world of Indian cinema). Alia Bhatt does an excellent job of looking pretty and staring into the middle distance as Sita and Ray Stevenson and Alison Doody (a Bond girl from A View To A KIll) are excellent value as the main evil Brits.Wikipedia tells me this is mainly a Telagu language film (the Brits speak an amusing mix of English and Telagu) and it's my first of the kind (it's my second Indian film, but the first was in Hindi). It's also the first Indian-produced film to win an Oscar - Best Original Song for ""Naatu Naatu"" (apparently that sequence was shot in Ukraine). Unsurprisingly, the film did quite well in India - it's the third highest grossing Indian film of all time.Once I immersed myself in the spirit of the film, I actually quite enjoyed it - my only quibble would be the running time because it just doesn't need to be over three hours (but I believe this isn't an uncommon occurrence with Indian films). You don't get a chance to get bored though - the scenes change so frequently and so radically that there's just no time for any of that nonsense. All in all, it was an enjoyable cultural experience, but not one I'm looking to repeat anytime soon - at time of writing, it's available to stream on Netflix or to rent at all the usual locations.",7/10,positive

I will definitely watch it twice!!!I like the background stories of the two guys - In Chinese we always call a country as ""country"" + ""family"" - and it was the thing here. When a country is in trouble, nobody can be sheltered - each household need to fight for the country.As a country once invaded by others, so many things made me cry for many times when watching. At one moment I was expecting the whole Indian to attack the british gov together, holding the whole scene to the next stage but ended up with them two to get all things done. It's over Marvel in a very positive meaning - Marvel is human pretend to be superman, they're supermen in the shells of human beings.Well done!!!

It's the true definition of 'silly fun'.The homoerotic elements are easy codes to decipher, but to be fair, male friendships are very different from what is seen/expected in the West. It just reads as a very very bromantic if not just straight-up romantic story. The two female alive interested are really left as throw ins to throw the scent! Lol.The action sequences are great.

The camera shots, direction is superb. There are scenes which you can't find in any Hollywood movie. Rajamauli Sir you just nailed it and keep doing this great and creative work.Now the 2 pillars of this movie, Ram Charan (The Fire) and Jr. NTR (The Water), they both did fantastic job. The entry of both of them are just unexpected and it's so amazing watch. No one can give that MASS entry to the lead actors. And energy both of them shown in NachoNacho song is so relaxing to watch.Action, direction, BGM everything was great. And at last Alia Bhatt and Ajay Devgan acted so well, even with small cameos they presented themselves so nicely.And yeah, it's not a one time watch movie & will surely plans to watch atleast 1 more time in multiplex.

tanzimalfardin,"RRR is way more belongs to Rajamouli than actors. Because, the way Rajamouli made this with a weak story and plot, that is fabulous. Rajamouli proved his visions are very aesthetic and well detailed. Action scenes are awesome except some scenes are illogical, though they were so touchy and impactful. You can watch this movie anytime as much as you want just because of Rajamouli's artistic and outstanding direction. Actors Actresses gave their best. That was impactful too. JR. NTR, Ram Charan was awsome with their performances. Ajay Devgan was marvellous. Loved it. Will watch it again many times.",7/10,positive
nbhamilton,"I was hoping this movie would cross the threshold in being so bad it's good; however, it never gets that far. It's just bad.Maybe I walked into this movie with too high of expectations but even with low expectations I would not recommend this movie to most people. It's a shame because it could've been so good if they had tweaked the dialogue and action scenes.The plot is one stereotype after the next and filled with the most absurd action scenes and dialogue. It's like a soap opera that was written by a 12 year old child. If you like professional wrestling or violent soap operas, then you'll probably love this movie.",2/10,negative

thejdrage,"This is a long movie - 3 hours. And it's so many things rolled into one!I have never seen an Indian produced movie, and was not disappointed. It had absolutely everything in it, except a kitchen sink. Music, dancing, critters (CGI so they weren't hurt nor did they consume any of the extras), good guys, bad guys, the list goes on and on for 3 hours. I DO wish there had been more dancing, but I also understand that's not what this was about.It is a full service movie. It has shoot outs galore, so love happening. There's SO much happening, I can't touch on it all without being here for 3 hours. Let's just say that if you haven't seen and Indian movie before - give this one a go.",8/10,positive

hessamlotfi,"I am not a fan of Bollywood cinema and I do not know more than two or three actors of Indian cinema by name. By chance, I started watching it on a television network. It was a bit confusing and incomprehensible to me at the beginning, even though I was watching the movie with translated subtitles, as it went on, I became more interested, until I couldn't put the movie down. The story is good. The actors are very good. The special effects are flawless. The music is great, the dances are very, very beautiful and captivating. The story line and rhythm of the film is suitable. This is one of those movies that you can sit down and watch again. Some moments of the dances are very original and I searched for its repetition on YouTube. I recommend watching this movie to any friend. It has good memorable moments. It is quite clear that in terms of Indian cinema, the film was very expensive and I have never seen such a production from Bollywood. I don't know if I could have given a score of 9 out of 10, it would have been better or not.",7/10,positive

jpismyname,"RRR is about two Indian revolutionaries, Khomaram Beem and Alluri Sitarama Raju, in the 1920s. The two revolutionaries never met in real life. This film is a fictional take, like what would have possibly happened if they met in real life?First of all, I really love the visuals and cinematography. It looks really breathtaking and beautiful. Love the acting of the main cast, their eyes alone are very expressive. The action scenes are also some of my favorite aspects, unbelievably amazing and even better than most Hollywood films tbh. I also love the story. While I'm not a fan of random musical numbers in some movies, it's an exception here. Really love it, especially that dancing scene.Really a well-done movie, and you could see how much effort and love they put in it. I'd give it like a 9.4 or 9.5, but whatever...I'll just give it a 10. It's a shame it wasn't submitted for Oscars, it would've been surely nominated.",10/10,positive

bankofmarquis,"Have you ever watched a Marvel (or other SuperHero) movie and think to yourself, ""I wish the action scenes were longer,"" and ""couldn't' Captain America and Iron Man (or Superman and Batman) have MORE powers,"" and ""couldn't there be a ton of additional special effects, even if they might be just a little more cheesy,"" and, ""instead of Iron Man and Captain America fighting some alien like Thanos, couldn't it be Davey Crockett and Thomas Jefferson fighting the British?"" Oh...and...""add in a few fantastical musical sequences (one of which ends up earning and Oscar for Best Song),""...and...""if it can be at least 3 hours long, that would great!""If this is you...do I have a movie for you!Streaming now on Netflix, the ""Bollywood"" film RRR (Rise, Roar, Revolt) is all that and more.Based on real revolutionaries Komaram Bheem and Alluri Sitarama Raju - both of whom led rebellions against British colonizers in the 1920s and 1930s - RRR is a fictitious version of the actual men (who never met in real life), and thus, sadly, never actually waged a two-man war on the occupying British Empire using Bengal Tigers, Wolves, Poisonous Snakes and other wild animals.Writer/Director S. S. Rajamouli, incredibly, brings this 3 hour fantasy/superhero/epic into being by asking ""what if"" all of the things listed above - and then delivers a highly satisfying fun time.Citing the very definition of ""willing suspension of disbelief"", lead actors N. T. Rama Rao, Jr. And Ram Charan dive headfirst into this bit of make believe with a wink in their eyes and a stubborn determination to bring some realism and grounding to their non-human, SuperHero characters - and darned if it doesn't work (even when they use ""magic mud"" to miraculously heal broken bones, deep gashes and torn ligaments).It's an absolute roller coaster of a film and one that needs to be experienced to be understood, but if you saw the musical number on the Oscars telecast, then you get a pretty good idea of what is in store for you.And, if you're in the right mood, it will be very fun.Thanks to all for recommending this thrill ride of a film.

rohitreviews,"Movie could have beeen good but it fails many ways in storyThe biggest letdown was the story, second half, and some bits of misalignment of how the story is framed.The story as in, they took both real-life characters and just didn't genuinely tell their life story or freedom struggle but it was more like, ""Oh these two are characters exists who you can check it online, and we used one's character to show saving the tribal girl, and another to avenge the father's death more in the pretext of stockpiling the weapons to wage war against brits"" that's it.This can't be called a good story. I would give it 1 or 2 just for the story, not even 7. I mean after the first attack at the party, the Brit leader could have easily shot the girl to settle things. But he goes on punishing the Bheema who was caught, which seems illogical if you think of it. Brits would have killed both girl and him back then. They often just want to kill as many people without any mercy, which is a fact. This didn't align with the genuine story. Think of Sardar Uddham, they showed they were merciless and hardly cared about kids or anyone if they wanted to shoot, they just did it. Just like Nazis. So it kind of didn't give needed liking from the start.Second half: The issue was, there is no setup of who Ajay was in the first place or his wife or those village army people he was training, and the one who was often seen with Ram to help him with his goals to get near weapons. I mean when they introduce Ram's character, they show him fighting with so many people to get one guy. The ferocity in which it's shown to fight all there just to get that guy, he could have simply killed the brits killed as they were short numbered and got the whole people's support charging them up to revolt and seeking their help to hide his identity and later can get the weapons. Why I'm saying this is, he does the same to Bheem and that time Bhim sings and makes every people raked up. It's still the same, isn't it?And this makes Ram believe in Bheem's ability to lead as he could be more force, while he had a similar opportunity at the start freely given. Both these two situations don't equate to the necessary logic of fighting against brits when brits were so cornered.. And both times Brit nowhere had any stronger points to create havoc and the only thing they held was the girl, whom they could have easily killed in reality.Framing of the story: I felt they should have started with Ajay being the older guy with young son Ram both fighting and it would have helped the second half making more thrilling effect.Overall it's a decent movie, won't say good or best, but just a one-time popcorn masala watch. Even Alia, Shreya, Ajay, and Tamil actor were so underutilized. Their existence too was pointless in a way. It could have been a best-made film if they genuinely tried to tell the real-life story of the characters even if wanted to go over the top sure like Sai Ra Narasimha Reddy's style.But what stood out and truly helped the movie was the performance of both Jnr NTR and Ramcharan, their bromance is the only thing which saved the movie-watching experience, I feel. It's not the story, it's their acting, a few good visuals. That's it.",4/10,negative

dhruv-gupta-250105,"This a movie of friendship with larger story of revolt against the Britishers based in the 1920s. This is one of those movies where the director has beautifully created a story which has all the elements of romance, action, dance, nationalism, spiritual angle as well (Ram taking the avatar of Lord Ram as per Hindu mythology and destroying Asurs - evil entity), a fictional story based on 2 national fighters based in 1920s. The movie depicts the emotional connect of a father and son (Ram and his father), friendship, romance between Ram and Situ which are in fact Hindu dieties in India married to each other. Excellent action sequences - one where Ram plots Bheem and Malli's escape the fight scenes are a delight to watch. Each actor even the support actors acted beautifully.

thePopcornExplorer,"In all honesty this was my first movie coming from Indian territory, I went with an open mind and with some notions that Bollywood movies are usually over the top / ridiculously unrealistic action flicks and I was pleased at the end.I do want to stress out that you need to keep in mind that the plot is nothing too complex, on the contrary is a fairly straight forward story (although some twists surprised me), the way I can better classify it is an uplifting (taking aside the few violent scenes) adrenaline pumped action movie with outstanding soundtrack and some pretty cool fight scenes.I am not aware of the budget restrictions, it's fair to assume that it doesn't compare to the huge American productions, and in the CGI department that shows and I would say is the weakest point of the film, taking that aside is refreshing to see movies from around the world and grasp the cultural aspect that they depict.It's a fictional story about two real life Indian revolutionary figures and their fight against the oppressive British empire. It's a very long movie however it was somehow easy to consume, I didn't feel bored the scenes are well constructed and even though its a basic story you will find yourself entertained by it and waiting for the cliché moments, which was strangely pleasant.I don't know how much of the stunts the main actors actually do but regardless if it was them doing it or the stunt folks it's a sight to behold.All in all I am really glad to see all of this inclusion of foreign films during award season, its good that we are globalizing our exposure to different cultures and it's a good mechanism to become more aware of everyone's roots and it has the potential to bring us all closer together.",8/10,positive
Nix_xx,"This is a spectacular spectacular spectacular film. I've never given a film or TV series a 10 before, but this movie was - for me - utter perfection.I'm not going to regurgitate the description of the movie as people can see that already. What is less obvious about the film from the trailer is how it is a wonderful mix of genres and how - despite this being a super long movie - the time will whizz by.So much is happening in this film and from scene to the next I was surprised - and wowed by the music, the beautiful cinematography, the dance scenes, the character development, and overall choreography. And while I'm someone that typically hates musicals (no judgement on those who love them!) the parts of this that fell into that genre, were fabulous. Found myself almost overwhelmed with pleasure and excitement at points - and cried at the most unlikely point, just because a tonne of dopamine was hitting my system and I was in awe of what humans can imagine, create, and pack into this movie.

Sometimes extra effects also not really making sense and does not look real. In a nutshell, movie is good to watch but not a memorable movie.I would have given 10 stars if they would have made a movie with little less extra effects and more towards story and acting.

jaredkjacoby,"When British governor Scott Buxton kidnaps a young girl from her tribe, the guardian of the tribe, Komaran Bheem vows to rescue the girl from her captives. Bheem enters the British Raj, the colonization of an Indian subcontinent by the British to get in Buxton's stronghold and rescue the girl. Aware of Bheem's presence, Buxton offers a special reward for the officer who brings him in. A. Ram Raju, an Indian officer with a lot of strength and talent, volunteers for the job and is instructed to bring him in alive. In a turn of events, they meet each other and not knowing each other's true identities, they end up becoming best friends after rescuing a child from a falling train on fire.The best way to describe this movie is that RRR is an action movie epic. This movie is one of the most glorious pieces of entertainment I have seen in years despite its three-hour runtime. There is not a single minute in this movie that is boring. There is always something crazy happening in the story whether it is a crazy action scene, a fun moment in the bromance, a comedic scene, a dramatic scene or even a lively musical number. RRR is a complete package.First of all, I adore the two protagonists, Bheem and Raju. Both of them are awesome in their characterization and in skills. Bheem is a kindhearted man who wants to rescue Malli and take down the evil British Empire. Despite this, he never targets anyone innocent. He does a great job disguising himself and he overall incredibly likable and endearing, especially with his interactions with Jenny. Raju on the other hand is one of my favorite characters in a movie this year. He fights a whole mob with his a blunt weapon, he encourages his friend in a dance off, he has the best arc in the movie and he has an interesting backstory. Raju is a fantastic character to the point where I actively rooted for his survival throughout the film. The bromance between Bheem and Raju is wonderful as well. They are so wholesome together, you forget that they have opposite goals while you see them hang out. N. T. Rama Rao Jr. And Ram Charan share some of the best chemistry I have seen in years. They act like best friends throughout the movie. The two leads make this movie a delight to watch.As for the rest of the characters, the British villains are quite despicable with Buxton and his wife being some of the most despicable people of the year. They are complex villains, but you want to see them go down in flames. Jenny is an interesting character. I thought she would be a twist villain who is only there to give the British Empire a good public face. Turns out, she is not really bad, just with bad people. I'm glad she ended up not being a villain, but I kind of wish she would have been a bigger character by the end. That is probably my only complaint in the entire film.The script is fantastic as well. The story engaged me from beginning to end between Raju's past, the friendship between Pheem and Raju, the conflict when they reveal themselves to each other and the adventure of the film. A great action movie has a great story and this movie is proof of that. It takes full advantage of its runtime to develop these characters and flesh out the themes and world of the movie. The tone is a perfect balance between lighthearted cheesiness and touching dark moments. When the movie gets cheesy, it is the fun cheese as this movie is hilarious with its humor and sequences. However, it pulls of its emotional moments well, including a torture scene that reminded me of Braveheart in some ways. The script packs a lot in one movie, but it delivers big time.The spectacle in this movie is out of this world. It puts many American blockbuster films to shame. This movie has at least three of my favorite set pieces of the year. The first infiltration of the stronghold, the rescue of the child at the train wreck and the insane climactic battle are all standout set pieces. Each one of them are not only a joy to watch, but they are creative in the way the stunts are performed and how the bad guys are taken out. The fights also show how Bheem represents water and how Raju represents fire, especially the one-on-one fight between the two. There is not a single action scene in this movie that is boring to watch. It is all so much fun. The sets and costumes are gorgeous as well. The cinematography is stunning as there are several jaw dropping shots and a couple solid takes. The only minor bad thing about the visuals are that some of CGI on the animals are not that great, but only when there is so much going on. The animals still look believable. I didn't question it at all except for maybe one or two scenes. The visuals in this movie are spectacular.Also, this movie has an awesome soundtrack. The musical score and main theme are great and fun to listen too, but this movie has some surprisingly robust musical numbers. The dance choreography is on point and so much fun to watch. It seems like every single person had a blast with this film.RRR is about as close to perfect as an action movie can get. This action epic proves that a good movie is never too long. Despite being three hours long, I did not once check my phone to see what time it was. This movie makes me want to watch more Bollywood films. I feel like I am missing out. This movie brought me so much joy that I almost want to watch again right after the first time. This movie is smart, creative, funny, heartwarming and bonkers in the best possible way. My only regret is that I did not see this movie when it was first released in theaters. For now, I will seek this film out on Blu-Ray as soon as I can.",10/10,positive
zubaieralam,Was expecting some thing more exciting like bahubali but end up watching an average rated movie with moderate storyline.Story plot was good but could have done better with twisted storyline.Acting performance for both ntr and ram was flawless . Casting is very surprising wheres an actress like alia bhaat hard to expect!!Enjoy with your family with a bucket of kfc spicy chicken😁😁,6/10,positive
Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,"Hey, Streamers! Word of mouth is a powerful tool in marketing a movie. I have been hearing about this epic, 3-hour action flick from India for the past few months. I heard that it was a spectacle full of high octane action sequences, musical performances and more that had to be seen to be believed. While I couldn't catch this one in the theater, Netflix has added RRR to its service. Here's how it goes.Yes, RRR is an epic, action movie about two men on a collision course with the British Empire in India. There is Bheem, who sets out to rescue Malli, a young girl from his tribe who was kidnapped by the British governor and his wicked wife. Then, there is Rama, an Indian police officer working for the British army. Bheem is fierce and ruthless, cunning and singularly focused on his goal to save Malli. Rama is equally fierce and ruthless and set on protecting the British government. As Bheem and Rama meet and become unlikely friends, secrets and hidden agendas lead to more than they both bargained for in their relationship and lead to the simmering revolutions against the British Empire.Despite its 3-hour run time, RRR is relentless. There are some lulls when the movie is setting up its plot, but it doesn't dwell much in exposition. Believe me, you may need a moment to breathe in between these action sequences. The film moves from action sequence to musical number and back. There are crazy visual effects and boundless energy coming from the screen through the camera movements and the actors.Actually, words cannot explain what this movie is really like. You just have to see it to believe it.RRR is a must-see movie. Sure, it's long, but don't let the runtime deter you. There is enough energy and action to fill the screen from beginning to end. It is surprising and worth the time spent. Grab a big box of popcorn and settle in for butt kicking and dancing and action in RRR.",8/10,positive

manuel1avila,"I just edited this review to add that I gave a second chance to RRR and enjoyed thoroughly as much as most people. I left my old review just to provide an insight on what could have changed. My 2 cents on how to enjoy RRR: Watch it with other people around and turn on your fantasy goggles.OLD REVIEW (Watching it alone and tired):It is really hard to know what to make of this movie. I watched (part of it) because Patrick H Willems recommended it, but I think he might have fallen to the emotion of a movie theatre packed with Indian cinema fans.Not only I am not unfamiliar with Indian movies, but some of them are among my all time favorites: 3 Idiots and Dangal would be the top ones. However, RRR looks like a parody of Indian movies: Over the top but stupid action, very bad special effects, idiotic plot, extremely poor acting and caricature-level bad guys are rampant throughout the film.I hope the otherwise promising Indian film industry won't get lost in the adoration of its hardcore fans and continue providing us with the amazing stories the west klacks of.If you want to watch an over the top but a lot more enjoyable indian film, look no further than Makkhi (Eega), a joy to watch and laugh with/¿at?",8/10,positive

amoebic_flowing,"It's refreshing to me that RRR portrays the British colonizers from the 1920s for what they actually were: utter villains. Too many western movies have brushed over - romanticized even - the many black pages of colonization and the devastation it has brought to local people.That on itself makes this movie an absolute gem to me.The plot is great for an action movie, the actionscenes are spectaculair, imaginative, over the top and just EXTRA in the best ways possible. The action-heroes of this movie have Chuck-Norris-level superpowers and it's thoroughly entertaining to watch. I fondly imagine children having fun reenancting some of these scenes.Like most commercial Indian cinema-productions this movie duration is around 3 hours. The movie doesn't allow you to get bored, though, not for even a second.Every part of RRR seems meaningful and interesting and it just completely works. The power of this movie is the culmination of the amazing sets, the jawdropping graphics, the thought-out choreography, the great costumes, the beautiful-will-stay-in-your-head-for-days-songs, the lovely actors, the bombastic music / soundscaping, the interesting shots, the obvious symbolism, the touching relationships between characters, the balance between scenes and the overall dynamic of several extremes.Is this movie actually perfect in every way possible? No, it's not, but that's what makes it perfect to me. I loooove me some drama and extraness. 🍿Might be one of my favorite movies of all time.",9/10,positive

Alluri Sita Rama Raju & Bheema are real characters and never came face to face in real life .. But this film plot is pure Fictional with realistic characters and brings these two heros together

bk753,"This film is not for everyone. The violence is off the charts, and the almost unfathomable depth of tribal loyalty, culture-driven friendship, and rage against an oppressor will be lost on many outside of the intended market. I'm absolutely dumbfounded by what I just watched, the sheer scope of this cinematic effort. I have never seen anything like it before, and doubt I will again. Which isn't to say it's all good.On almost every level this is a monumental film, even if at times it's monumentally stupid. But OMG, it's fun! It's absurd, insane, fast-paced, incomprehensibly violent, ridiculous fun. The acting isn't great but the characters are. The dialogue is half-baked but the message is fully cooked. Good vs. Evil in an epic, derailed, absurd, visually stunning, three-hour thrill ride. It fails in many way, but it never fails to entertain, good or bad. Despite its flaws, i'm giving it an ""8"" for the sheer cinematic spectacle it is. Watch at your own risk, but be prepared to be mesmerized.",8/10,negative

Retrostudious,"It's amazing how Indian cinema can make what I would call negatives in Western cinema really entertaining. Maybe they get the balance right by going balls-to-the-wall with the over-the-top moments. Rather than trying to be realistic with it, they embrace the madness. Western cinema makes the mistake of portraying realism but then failing by not thoroughly researching their subject or understanding basic physics. Indian cinema, on the other hand, tells physics and logical storytelling to sod off.This is a world where a one-man army with the strength of 20 men can take on a rioting crowd with many aggressors, where a man can take down and trap a tiger with sheer strength and will that defies impossible odds, and where dance numbers and storybeats appear without any rational as to why they are happening.

Alia Bhatt and Ajay Devgan are just cameos. Though beautifully played. The British behave stereotypical almost like Lagaan. BGM and VFX are top notch.

vietorisz,I never give a movie 10/10 BUT THIS PEOPLE!!! It is totally OMG. Just heard of it after winning at golden globes the best song. After watching that specific scene on youtube I went watching it on my 100 inch home cinema big screen and I urge everyone to do that too because is big loud gorgeous fun stupid homoerotic unrealistic but enjoyable and it keeps you entertained all the way... yep 3 hrs. It's good to have a break half way. The scenes are fantastically composed on several levels the coloring the cgi the fullness of each scene the characters that are empathically engaging the sound and of course the music and the songs all with subtle tones from other big blockbusters. I even heard some Ga Ga rhythms in there and a big chunk of the soundtrack is inspired from Avatar 1. Speaking of Avatar 2 should have been like this. Three hrs on Avatar 2 was hell this was entertainment. Mr Cameron if you haven't seen it I really recommend you do.,10/10,positive

brawlmedia,"I would have given this movie a 3 star ratings but since most reviews here are fake, i will give 1. If there was an option for zero, i would have given that.Coming to the movie, the protagonist arrests a protester by fighting 1000 people. This is done to show power of protagonist. Other protagonist can control animals.After 2 weeks and barely getting food, how can one suddenly do exercise and be so strong?If one does exercise without eating food, he wil develop muscle wasting and ketone bodies will be formed. I don't know how a person maintains same muscle after not eating for 2 weeks. If they have any tricks, i want to know it.The most depressing part is villains are portrayed as complete villains. There is no perspective from their side. This is like a 19th century movie where whatever protagonist does is right, and villains are always wrong.If 2 people can destroy a entire British battalion and can defeat 1000 protesters, then why didn't we get independence in 1912. Maybe the movie has a 2nd part where they give independence to us.Also this movie is categorised under historical drama, then why does protagonists have strength higher than most superheroes.I don't know why they have to ruin our image by sending bad movies worldwide, please if you have any vested interest, do in local market, don't insult us by sending such illogical movies.",1/10,negative

I have to say that I got complete satisfaction for the money I spent. Both NTR and Ram Charan did amazing performance and gave their best. All the other actors did their roles perfectly. I have to say that I never even moved my stance throughout the movie. Such was the excitement.I am not sure why there are some people criticizing the roles in this movie.

The movie has a running time of close to 3 hours. However there is not a single moment that takes your focus away from the screen. What a well written screenplay. Regarding technical aspects, SSR, at this point is challenging himself proving again why he is one of the greatest present day film directors.

3. Great VFX level of hollywood
4. Watch out for some extra ordinary scene like when Bheem goes to the British residence with a truck full of Animals, Rama Avtar scene, When bheem helps Rama escape and many more
5. Great acting by both the lead actor but also from the British characters.Cons
1. Motivation for the revolutionary step was not easy to digest
2. English dialog can be made in Narration mode in regional languages.3. Little too much projection of a power of a character like Rama fighting a group of thousand mobs aloneBut overall the movie is a treat to watch, it will not disappoint anyone.

From the very first scenes, you get drawn into the ridiculous, overt displays of testosterone that make fun of every cliche you've ever seen in action movies - slow-motion roars of agony or rage, wrestling matches with lions, motorcycles used as melee weapons... But you also get heart-felt stories of kidnapped village girls and rebellion against foreign government, a big dance-off scene and musical numbers. This movie has it all! The running time is certainly long and you may have to take a break simply to recover your ability to laugh, but it is enjoyable throughout.",8/10,positive

Its very difficult and one more scene makes me funny . Ram charan is in prision and his knees are broken and ntr lifted into his shoulder and ran like a marathon 😂😂😂😂 the biggest failure of this film is after putting any ayurvedic medicine to ram charan knees he will be fine with in 2 min and fight with enemies .

NRJ0rdan,"From the moment I sat down to write about this cinematic masterpiece, I was overwhelmed by the myriad emotions it stirred within me. This film is a remarkable exploration of the human condition, masterfully depicting the cruelty and complexity that define us. Its aesthetic execution is flawless, striking a perfect balance that captivates the viewer's senses and emotions.The narrative seamlessly weaves laughter, tears, and awe, offering a refreshingly innovative perspective on historical storytelling.The performances are nothing short of spectacular, with actors delivering authenticity even in moments of levity. Each scene, whether poignant or light-hearted, is crafted with precision, ensuring that the humor enhances rather than detracts from the film's depth. The musical numbers and choreography are executed with such grace and relevance that they enrich the storyline, appearing exactly when needed to elevate the narrative.I extend my deepest gratitude to everyone involved in the creation of this film. It's a rare gem that deserves widespread acclaim and recognition. As a fervent admirer of cinema, it has been some time since a film has touched me so profoundly.Despite the big cast, the movie navigates its multitude of characters with ease, avoiding any sense of overcrowding, preachiness, or gratuitous violence. It's a testament to the skillful storytelling and direction that the film maintains its coherent and impactful message throughout.Do yourself a favor and watch this.",10/10,positive

Sad expressions are well captured and well acted.5. Interval fight scene is awesome.6. NTR's entry CG is awesome, and NTR's muscle straining scene is aggressive., and chasing by Lion is hair raising.7. Ram charan's entry scene is very raw and shows that he is really the fire.8. Naatu naatu dance is a special mention, well choreographed.9. Climax scene slow motion is ultimate.

dgreatpulak,"An excellent movie with great action scene and great dance song. Great background music. An exceptional movie a must watch. Worth buying ticket. Shot composition was too good which is one aspect I always appreciate in SSR movies. The use of the foreground in the earlier frames of this spectacle subtly taught us about the environment we are being transported to. Cinematography by Senthil truly blew my mind, the use of rack focuses was very unique in a minimal way. To emphasize SSRs vision, Senthil grasped the landscapes of the rural, industrial, and british raj settings of historical India using establishing shots and aerial views innovatively. The team did great work during post-production (color correction) as the warm hue that glazed the screen made everything feel that much more Indian. CGI might be my own gripe but considering the budget every penny was used effectively. Regardless, SSR knows how to immerse us into the emotional baggage of the storytelling, making us forget we are looking at CG elements altogether. An example of SSR and Senthils collaborative eye for detail was the precision of the dust after Ram beats his punching bag, ensuring the specular highlights glared off of the environment (Ram, punching bag and every spec of dust) making us feel the weight of Ram's punches.",10/10,positive

thelandofoo,"To start off straight, this movie won't be for everyone. Just know that when you walk into this film, you'll be given a glimpse into Indian culture and how they express themselves. While certain creative choices may seem odd to the casual Western viewer, it's just a normal occurrence for Indian audiences, as we are treated with dance numbers, action scenes that say ""Physics be damned!"", and many moments that are melodramatic. How much it will work for you will depend on how wide your taste is and how open minded you are willing to be. If you do end up checking it out for yourself and are willing to stick with it to the end, I think there's a chance you'll be rewarded with a good time. What about me? I found it to be a fun story that was made with a lot of spirit. The two leads are great, with one of them given an awesome introduction that manages to set up the character with little use of dialogue. The story also involves universal themes that can help viewers identify with the characters. The runtime of the movie does become a bit of an issue though. This film is over three hours long and at points I did feel that. I did also feel that the structure could have been better and that there was better time management regarding certain scenes and revelations. When all is said and done, ""RRR"" is a recommendation from me if you are looking for something different or craving some over the top action (the third act delivers and with a good payoff). Final verdict: 8/10.",8/10,positive

mickeythechamp,"Road to the Oscars 2023. This movie is nominated for 1 award and it´s best original song for the song ""naatu naatu"". This movie reminded me of a meme. The ""what kind of movie are we making?"" ""yes"" meme. This is a movie that has a bit of everything, from action, drama, a tiger fight, a man on shoulder shootout, music videos, romance. You won't leave this movie without feeling like you have just seen a movie with everything in it. It´s been a while since I let my guard down and just had fun, this movie reminded me not everything has to be high art and tell a lifechanging story, sometimes movies are entertainment, and this movie is that pure entertainment. It reminds me of the golden age of action in Hollywood in the 80s, big men, big ideas, big scopes. While Hollywood no longer has the same punch when it comes to action magic in my opinion since it everything now has to be overly serious, this movie took it a step back and just had fun. Bollywood just has something about it and while I don't like everything it has to offer, it showed me the pure enjoyment you can have while watching movies.In a British colonialized India a little girl is bought from a village in a misunderstanding. Bheem sets out to find the girl again in the big city, meanwhile the military man Raju is set out to find and capture Bheem in order to become the highest rank in the military. The two people find each other and befriends each other, not knowing they are enemies. Their alliance is destined to be tested.Let´s start out with a really strong aspect of the movie, it´s incredible score and it´s songs. I loved the songs in the movie and thought they fitted the themes. Even one song I really thought was out of place had an incredibly impactful conclusion that made it work. I know musicals are also a western phenomenon, but you have to get used to their being songs all the time here. But again so much energy and production is clearly brought into the songs and they are preformed amazingly. I totally get why Naatu Naatu is nominated that song is incredible and in the context of the movie even better. The score is also really well done and I loved motives like Raju´s theme, it was so good and really made him sound intimidating. I also really liked the recontextualization of the friendship song between Bheem and Raju, it is reorchestrated many times doing the movie to give it new meanings and it worked so well.While a lot of things happens in this movie the story is rather simple. Bheem needs to find the little girl and Raju has to find out who his after which is Bheem. It´s a well told simple story and as Rajus story is expanded upon during the movie, you start to see them both as well meaning people.But this movie is 3 hours long and really packs it´s punches. First you have to sit through 2 minutes of logos btw, fair warning, but after that I goes wild. There are tiger fights, superhuman strength, insane stunts, an epic escape, gun fights, fist fights, horse and motorcycle stunts, insanely good singing and dancing choreography. There are genre aspects of romance, action, drama, musical, war. While it can sound like a lot, and it is, it feels like the movie's identity. It´s supposed to be everything, and the balance works for the most part and keeps reinventing itself so it doesn't get stale or boring.The entire movie is carried by the two leads. N. T. Rama Rao Jr. As Bheem and Ram Charan as Raju. I think both did an outstanding performance and really managed to mix humor, bromance, action, seriousness, singing and dancing into all out performances. In the end I think Rama Rao Jr. Became my favorite, he also had to balance romance and managed both to pull of the cute and innocent acting while becoming this intimidating warrior when he had to. He also showed of his beautiful singing voice and his insane dance moves. Same could be said about Charan, he shows this amazing bromance side to him and I really believe the two leads friendship, Charans serious acting is so intimidating and he really brings that to the character. He also showed his insane dancing and singing skills. I loved the way that these two are seen as opposites that are supposed to learn from each other. They have the same vision but different approaches to it. Seeing them finally embrace each other is so epic and moving at the same time.The invadable fight is epic and the action in general is amazing. This is one of those hype movies where you cheer every time something happens. The movie earns this and I sat with a smile on my face whenever something incredible happened.The effects aren't good in this movie. The animals look terrible, and some action effects looked really bad. While they still impacted me as I was immersed in the movie, it was more the idea of what happened and not really the effect themselves that brought it to life.This is a really unserious movie that still had it´s serious moments. The plot in Rajus village, and the underlying theme and thread of colonialism is scary and really brought out to the extreme in full display. This is a movie showing that India is free today and that the shadows of the past are still looming but feels defeated. These themes were well implemented and an easy way to created an impactful antagonist.With a movie with so much going on I have to take my hat of to the director. S. S. Rajamouli really balances everything so well and has created a movie that feels like it works even though it really shouldn't. There are so many images, scenes and elements that sticks out to me remembering back on the movie and making 3 hours fun from start to finish is an achievement on its own.I must admit that when the movie hit its second hour, I felt the length a bit. But then something happened that made me kickstart back up. This movie really has the ability to kickstart you whenever it´s going down a bit.In general, this movie is not supposed to change your life or make deep cuts, it´s supposed to make you laugh and cheer and that it does well. It captures the pure fun and entertainment you can have by watching a movie. It´s been a while since I let a movie do that to me, but this one reawakened something pure in me that made me throw away the cynicism and just enjoy the ride.RRR is a blast from start to finish. It has a bit of everything and is one of the most epic things I´ve seen in a while. Not only is it fun, it´s also emotional and creates this pure form of entertainment that I have been missing for a while.Oscar predictions: So we can only judge this movie from the award it has been nominated for and that is the song ""Naatu Naatu"". First, I can´t wait to see this song being performed at the Oscars. If they bring just half the energy, they brought for the movie it will be an amazing show. Sadly, I don't think this is going to win. When you have American stars like Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Diana Warren and Mitski all on separate nominees I think the academy is going safe and not foreign. I haven't heard all the songs yet so maybe ""Naatu Naatu"" is the best but I don't know. The only one I have heard is the song from Black Panther and Everything Everywhere all at Once and I think personally that ""Naatu Naatu"" is better than bot, but I guess music is subjective.",8/10,positive

ajitsarker-22354,"The story of the movie might seem pretty simple and straightforward in the beginning but as the movie goes on the drama gets more intense. The friendship between the two lead characters is shown in a fantastic way. The relation between a father and a son is also portrayed nicely. Ramcharan and Jr. Ntr both are terrific. They've done a fantastic job in bringing the characters of Ram and Bheem on screen. Ajay Devgan and Alia Bhatt are in a brief but meaningful role and they've delivered their part nicely. Music and bgm are absolutely fantastic. Songs have been written in a very meaningful way and each of them elevates specific sequences and tells us more about the story, characters and the emotions portrayed throughout the movie. The movie has great visuals and it's a delight to watch them on full hd display. Action sequences are over the top but designed in such a creative and smart way that it becomes a joy to watch them. Interval and climax were terrific. Overall a visual treat and must watch film on theatres.",9/10,positive

Apart from action, he has proudly showcased Indian tradition and culture, such as patriotism, the power of Ayurveda, animal study, pulse-pounding music and much more. Sacrifice and friendship are nicely presented in this movie. Both the actors have given their best performances in the films. Hats off to the entire team of RRR.",10/10,positive
movies-boy83,Non sense and extremely boring movie. The director Rajamouli may have imagination but absolutely no common sense. Only a senseless person can make movie where freedom fighters are seen dancing with British royals and racing on bullet bikes. The unrealistic stunt scenes completes the picture as the worst ever indian movie on a high budget. He could have donated the money instead to feed some poor instead.,1/10,negative

bjadunathmurmu,"A great movie of all time.. About vfx, storyline and casting all are incredible😍.What is special about RRR?RRR nabbed the win for best original song at the 2023 Golden Globe Awards, receiving the honor for ""Naatu Naatu"" (Telugu for ""Native Native""), the famed musical number that sees Charan and Rao burst into song and break into synced-up choreography. Rajamouli came across stories about the lives of Rama Raju and Bheem and connected the coincidences between them, imagining what would have happened had they met, and been friends. The film was announced in March 2018. Principal photography of the film began in November 2018 in Hyderabad and continued until August 2021, owing to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was filmed extensively across India, with a few sequences filmed in Ukraine and Bulgaria. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani, with cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad. Sabu Cyril is the film's production designer whilst V. Srinivas Mohan supervised the visual effects.",10/10,positive

The main characters come up with a complicated plan to save a child involving rope, a motorcycle, a horse, and the flag of India by looking at each other once and nodding. The special effects are so incredibly well done, and the corny parts are done corny on purpose. The music singles were great, and the somewhat shallow exploration of the cultural differences between the invading English and the native Indians is cool. Why does the queen have a whip with spikes?

It was a clean heart felt movie! No masala, no wahiyaat-ness with a beautiful story. When I started hearing all the hype about RRR...(even though I don't understand the language) I decided to give it a shot. I must say, while the action was over the top for me... it had a beautiful story which can be watched with the whole family. A nice clean movie that can be enjoyed and for that I give it a 10! Bollywood needs to stop competing with Hollywood and stay true to what they were. Their audience is Indian and I think they have forgotten that! Make a nice, clean, heart warming movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family and it will work. Learn something from your south industry! They don't need item songs or a wahiyaat story to make their movie a hit!",10/10,positive

The evil British tyranny is a bit excessive and the CGI is a bit obvious, but still looks good.

Indian movies are a celebration of life. Like RRR, Indian movies take you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions and leave you satisfied, like you have enjoyed a tasty meal. It's fulfilling entertainment. Indian movies make you want to dance, fight, laugh and cry. RRR is that definition of Indian entertainment. I think Bollywood has been stuck in a rut for a while. RRR has revitalized Indian cinema and shown me that there are alternatives to the Bollywood bore. RRR is entertaining from the first frame to the last. Visually it is just stunning. Its over the top, but Indian movies usually don't take themselves to seriously, Indian movies are made to entertain. RRR is an entertainer par excellence. The only small criticism I have is that I don't think Alia Bhatt was suitable for her role. Her performance was poor in the context of this film. Bollywood is Hindi cinema, RRR is not from Bollywood. So RRR makes a huge statement: Indian cinema is not just Bollywood! RRR is the savior of Indian cinema and deserves every accolade it gets!",10/10,positive

Perspicuity1,"Rise Roar Revolt (RRR) may not be at par with Baahubali, as far as storytelling is concerned, but one can't deny that it is a visual spectacle that has set a new benchmark in Indian cinema. The first thing that I had noticed during the teasers of the film were the beautiful visuals, the camera was capturing everything to the minutest detail and the special effects were way better than what I had seen in any other Indian film. When you see the film, you realize that the filmmaker has not compromised anywhere as far as visuals are concerned, every single frame looks absolutely stunning. RRR engages you right from the beginning with a melodious as well as an unusual musical interlude, and by the time the title of the film appears on screen, you realize that it's been 40 minutes already! The way RRR unfolds, introducing the central plot and its main leads is very unique and creative. The introduction scene of Ram Charan was very good, but Jr. NTR's introduction gave me goosebumps, it was a breathtaking sequence. The background score during the chase sequence in Jr. NTR's introduction had my pulses racing, it was absolutely amazing. The tiger and the wolf shown in that scene looked very real, it's mind-boggling to see where we have reached as far as VFX is concerned. Baahubali was criticized for having poor VFX, especially towards the end, but you can't do that here.The appearance of the title card with that amazing background score, is the kind of moment where people often start clapping and shouting. Sung by Blaaze, that song increases your excitement level and fills your heart with happiness. It makes you realize that the director and writer have really put in a lot of effort to make this film an experience to remember. An extremely engaging and entertaining storyline, brilliant acting by Ram Charan and Jr. NTR, outstanding music by M. M. Keeravani, stunning visuals and VFX; one would assume that the director has possibly thrown everything towards the viewers from his box of wonders, but that wasn't true, Rajamouli had kept something hidden from everyone. The spectacular action sequence right before the interval left me awestruck and lit up my eyes, because I had never seen something like this before in my life in a movie. Indian cinema took a giant leap in that sequence, announcing to the world that we too have the vision and imagination to create something that would drop your jaws to the floor. That action sequence culminated an extremely strong first half, and it goes without saying that very few Indian films could boast of putting up a show like that.The second half of RRR is not as compelling as the first half, this is where the screenplay loses steam and the movie falls short of being called a masterpiece. Of course there are plenty of moments that have brilliance written all over them. The acting remains top quality, from Ram Charan as well as Jr. NTR, Jr. NTR is quite exceptional during his whipping sequence with the brilliant Komuram Bheemudo song playing in the background, the flashback sequence involving Ajay Devgan and Shriya Saran is quite impactful, their cameos are of short duration but both Ajay and Shriya have acted very well, the song 'Janani' hits you emotionally. The cameo of Alia Bhatt however, puts forth a question as to why was she selected for the role. Alia Bhatt made no impact at all in that five minute role. Perhaps the director should have expanded that role and given it to some other actress, like Tamannaah, the lead actress of his previous film. The action sequence where Ram and Bheem escape from the prison is very well choreographed and is quite entertaining to watch, even though it's quite difficult to believe that such an escape is even possible. The climax is where the film falters, the believability factor goes for a toss and you are left wondering as to how this is happening? Ram was severely injured after escaping from prison, he hadn't eaten for days, he was lying down in a semi-conscious state because of tiredness, and then all of a sudden he was shown fighting with full energy in a new wardrobe. Bullets were being fired from everywhere but not a single one touched him, how? How can you possibly compete with bullets flying from everywhere using a bow and an arrow? By the time you would load a new arrow, three bullets would have already pierced your heart!The finale of the movie feels weak, because the plot is not quite there and also the villains couldn't really make any kind of impact, they were given the bare minimum to do and they did that with the same expression on their face. One would expect the villains to be menacing and scary, the presence of whom would send a chill down your spine, but no such thing happened, the villains were like cardboard characters who could talk and walk. I don't know what made the casting team select such bad white actors for this film and why did the writer give the villains such a wafer thin storyline. The main storyline of the film was to find Malli and send her safely to her mother, and I was really happy when that happened, but the way just two individuals overpowered an entire police force, who were armed with all sorts of weapons, was a bit difficult to digest. I do realize that movies often portray heroes as superheroes, so one should keep that in mind while watching them, but some sort of plausibility has to be kept alive. Rajamouli has indicated that the character Ram turns into a magical figure that night, but that transition was not conveyed properly. Also, he did get hit by a bullet towards the end, so he wasn't exactly invincible, so how did he survive hundreds of bullets that got fired towards him from all directions that night?Despite the not so convincing climax and some plot holes, RRR remains a fantastic movie watching experience. Director S. S. Rajamouli and writer Vijayendra Prasad deserve to be praised for imagining something as epic as this. M. M. Keeravani needs to be mentioned because the outstanding music of this film has been composed by this genius musician. The movie has been created in a way that you just can't take your eyes off the screen, the screenplay is extremely engaging and fast paced, even the dance number 'Naatu Naatu' (choreographed by Prem Rakshith) has so much energy that you just don't want it to end. The visuals are so stunning, it makes you wonder as to why filmmakers travel abroad when our own India is so beautiful. RRR is not at the level of Baahubali, but S. S. Rajamouli has scaled new peaks with this film. It may not be a perfect film, but it's one hundred percent worthy of your time.",9/10,positive
luca-lindhorst,"Let's start with the bad things, because there aren't much:Some of the CGI is a bit janky at times, but given there amount of VfX shots it's excusable. Somewhere near the end before the prisoner escapes there is a bit too much plot convenience.But apart from that this movie is just ingeniously made, every cut, every shot, every slowmow just helps to drive the story foward. There are a lot of cool action, but every action scenes drives plot and story foward, nothing is there to just look cool. It is a 3h long movie and not one scene gets boring or to slow. Every song/dance is telling the story and progressing it. Every flashback and exposition is just given at the right moment not too soon not too early.I am not sure what else to say, maybe there are movies more serious, with stronger plot and or character development, but I've never have seen a movie where every cinematic technique in every scene is successfully used to tell the story.

There are quite a few of far fetched moments, which usually I'd find upsetting, but this didn't take from how epic the movie was regardless. And sitting at just over 3 hours, I thought I'd have a hard time watching it all, but it genuinely kept its pacing perfectly. The drama, the action, the suspense, even the music numbers were perfect and intriguing. I honestly want a sequel to this, and soon.

classicsoncall,"Going in, your best bet is to suspend disbelief right out of the gate. Following the kidnapping of a young tribal girl by the governor of the province, a military police officer beats off dozens of assailants, not to mention the thousands in near proximity who don't get a chance to subdue Rama Raju (Ram Charan). For his miraculous escape from the rioting crowd, Raju is overlooked when selection for an elite police unit takes place. However, he gets his opportunity when the governor's wife (Alison Doody) pledges a special promotion for whoever rises to the occasion to stop a relentless tribal member who vows to rescue Malli (Twinkle Sharma) from her British captors.Indian movies are notable for their lengthy run times and creative use of song and dance numbers. The highlight here is the Desi Naach, described by the participants as the 'Crazy Dance' performed by Raju and Komaram Bheem (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.), using his alias as a village mechanic named Ahktar. The pair came together following a mind-blowing team up that would have made James Bond proud when they rescued a young boy from a train explosion. It was at that point the movie entered 'Crouching Tiger' territory with skilled wire work that would have defied probability in a real-life circumstance. Perhaps even more impressive than the early mob scene and the colorful 'Crazy Dance' was the later assault on the governor's palace led by Bheem, replete with a menagerie of wild animals in an attack on the governor's residence. To describe Governor Buxton's (Ray Stevenson) home as palatial would be a definite understatement, you just have to see it.The story keeps one on edge regarding the relationship between Raju and Bheem. Considering each other as friends early in the picture, Raju's position as a police officer compels him to arrest Ahktar/Bheem when the latter's actions pose a threat to the British ruling government. No attempt is made to portray Governor Buxton, his wife and assorted soldiers as anything less than ruthless individuals incapable of sensitivity to the plight of the native population. It all works out of course, as the rival combatants join forces once again to rescue Malli, with Raju fulfilling a fifteen-year-old promise to arm his people in a decades old quest for freedom from British forces.Though it's quite long, the story holds one's interest while action fans get an overdose of thrilling stunt sequences and impressive fighting battles. The film won an Oscar for Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures with the song 'Naatu, Naatu', though it's virtually overwhelmed by the intrigue between the principal characters.",9/10,positive

sujanfaster,"I almost started this review by saying ""the most anticipated movie is finally.."" but then at this point of time almost every movie is because of what has happened in the last 2 odd years. I am both a big fan and also a big critic of SS Rajamouli's filmmaking. His grandeur is unmatchable but also at times there are some scenes in his movies which ruin the whole experience because of how unreal they are (for example tata sumo jump in Magadheera and human cannonball from Bahubali). With RRR Rajamouli probably creates a great balance between the emotional quotient and the extravaganza. RRR is one of its kind theatrical experience despite not such a great storyline.I really don't want to say anything about the plot, anyone who has seen a lot of movies can figure out the plot just from the trailer. It is clear that Rajamouli wants to establish the two great characters from the beginning and also wants to do it beautifully by bringing the elements ""Fire and Water"". He has done a very good job by not writing unnecessary characters for the sake of it. The movie is all about the two leading men and it does the justice. It goes without saying that the movie is technically brilliant, costume and set designs are pretty much on point and the camera work is exceptional.There are two great scenes in the movie involving each of the lead actors that make you gasp and when you walk out of the cinema hall you will be recalling those scenes frame by frame. There are also really over the top scenes, but you know what you signed up for when you are entering Rajamouli's fantasy world. To be honest, I wasn't really a fan of the song ""Naatu Naatu"" when it was released on YouTube, but Ram Charan-NTR's chemistry, the choreography and all the supporting dancers make it a mesmerizing watch. The other songs are also placed well in the movie and MM Keeravani does a commendable job with the background score especially when connecting the mythological elements to it.I personally feel that the movie is probably a bit too lengthy than it should have been. The narration is crisp in the first half, but in the second half it keeps running around in circles. There are some scenes which almost end like an episode of a TV series and it feels like the story would make a great mini-series. I also think that Rajamouli misses a great opportunity to add some mystery around Ram Charan's character which could have made for a great twist somewhere in the second half. The police station scene almost reminds you of the classic scene from 'Vikramarkudu' and the colour palette is similar as well. Ajay Devgn's character also could have had more build up to it, but I understand the compromise the director had to make for the running time. Ajay Devgn's perfect delivery of three simple English words makes an impactful watch.RRR is purely written around the two leading characters and both Jr NTR and RamCharan execute their roles to perfection. One can do nothing but applaud for all the efforts and commitment they have shown in the characters and their hard work is clearly evident be it the dance or the fight scenes. Ram Charan has probably put in his career's best performance and to see him in Ram Avatar is some experience in the theaters. Jr NTR is brilliant as well but the writing around his character lacks a bit of depth as compared to the other lead. The rest of the supporting characters have not so much to do and it is good to see that their roles aren't unnecessarily elongated. Although Hollywood actor Ray Stevenson makes for a good evil British officer, the movie suffers from a lack of strong antagonist as the storyline is about Indian freedom struggle. The British characters and accents are more authentic as opposed to other Indian movies but it is also due to the evolution of cinema in general.Everyone's heard of the phrase ""Actions speak louder than words"" and boy does Rajamouli make it clear with this epic cinematic adventure.",8/10,positive

vigneshgreycell,"This movie is just hype, no substance at all! There is only mindless violence for most part, reeking of over heroism and absolutely mindless antics. This story is entirely fictional, too caricatured and over promotes Hindutva agenda subliminally in every other scene. History is distorted out of shape as well in that process! Unfortunate that a movie like this gets so much hype and also gets backed by a huge star cast. Deserves 0 stars, but this site doesn't give that option, so forced to give one star (grudgingly)! Definitely not worth 3 hours of anyone sensible person's time. Plain ridiculous nonsense. Glad that I didn't watch this in a theatre. OTT existing was bad enough for this.

lakkarajunagarjuna,"Being honest, no par over hero's.I would like to share my experience/euphoria of RRR on first day.Would like to congratulate both RC & NTR for their extraordinary / lifetime performances for RRR. They kept their heart/soul & blood for the characters. The rest of the team were okay for their roles.Let's talk abt the story, I (my point of view) somewhere felt the story is been VERY THIN / DILUTED compared to the star cast. As we all know it's really hard for SSR on balancing the best actors from the industry, and as they are not only actors but the representatives of two big families. Still, the captain balanced the characters RAM/BHEEM, they both dominated the Story and stole the show. BGM/DOP/FIGHTs are excellence.RAM opening fight/BHEEM intro scene & TIGER fight/Pre Interval/ Pre Climax / Ram transformation to ALLURI / BHEEM innocence / Emotions through out the film are main assets.Story is a little back drop as said, both RC & NTR dominated the complete story.VFX is really good. Visuals are outstanding, SSR is next level.Verdict: 4/5
Can watch twice for their hard work. Repeated audience are guaranteed for RRR.Final word:
SSR films are slow poison, it will hit the bulls eye for sure.",9/10,positive

Love it.SS Rajamouli's much awaited magnum opus RRR has released in theatres on March 25. The period drama brings together two of Telugu cinema's biggest stars - Ram Charan and Jr NTR. The movie also stars Alia Bhatt and Ajay Devgn in extended cameos.The excitement is high among the team of RRR too. Jr NTR, who's previously collaborated with SS Rajamouli in Student No 1 (2001), Simhadri (2003) and Yamadonga (2007), said, ""This movie will be an emotional rollercoaster. There will be times when you'll hold onto your seats, wanting to pull it out, rip it apart. You'll laugh, cry, you'll be many things!""The movie is Dam osam just watch it.",10/10,positive

debubhutu,"Many people, including fans of Jr NTR and Rajamouli, have defended the portrayal saying it could have been from a scene in the film where the actor disguises himself as a Muslim man to infiltrate the Nizams. Many others pointed out that Rajamouli has clearly stated in the past that the film is a fictional account based on freedom fighters Alluri Sitarama Raju (from the coastal Andhra region) and Komaram Bheem (from the Adilabad region). While Sitarama Raju was born around 1897, Komaram Bheem was born around 1900.""There are gaps in the lives of these legendary freedom fighters that we don't know about ... It is through this fictional story that we'd like to show what could have happened in their lives and what would have happened if they met and bonded,"" Rajamouli had said at an event last year.A video introducing the other protagonist of the film, Ram Charan in the role of Alluri Sitarama Raju, was released earlier in March. Alluri Sitarama Raju led the Rampa Rebellion of 1922 against the British Raj's Madras Forest Act of 1882 that restricted the land rights of tribal people. The video showed Ram Charan wearing the uniform of a police officer, and people pointed out that there is no record of Alluri Sitarama Raju ever being a police officer either.Recently, responding to speculations about the film, the filmmakers wrote on Twitter that the two protagonists do not fight for independence in the film. ""#RRRMovie is entirely fictional and not at all a patriotic film,"" said an official tweet. The film's Twitter account calls it, ""A fictional tale of Indian revolutionaries in the 1920s.""",1/10,positive

eddie_baggins,"Like John Wick, La La Land and Braveheart had a hyperactive and wildly over the top Bollywood baby, RRR (standing for Rise, Roar, Revolt) became one of the rare success stories of 2022, making its way to 100's of million of dollars at the global box office, a raft of positive critical reviews and in excess of 50 wins at various global award ceremonies where it has also found itself competing at this years Academy Awards in the Best Original Song category for its standout musical number ""Naatuu Naatuu"".Distributed in multiple territories through streaming giant Netflix, RRR has become a genuine cinematic phenomenon, breaking global viewership records on the platform since it found a home there in the middle of 2022 and it's not hard to see why S. S. Rajamouli colourful three hour epic (which would probably be cut down to around 2 hours if you got rid of the slow-motion) has found so many fans across the globe.Working as both a soap opera drama, a rip roaring action flick that features some of the most memorable action scenes of any feature film over the past decade and importantly an enjoyable bromance adventure between N. T. Rama Rao Jr.'s determined villager Komaram Bheem and Ram Charan Teja's one man army officer Alluri Sitarama Raju, RRR is many things but at its core it's an effortlessly fun experience that should never be and was likely never looking to be taken seriously as Rajamouli goes all out in making sure his epic is a sensory experience in more ways than one.Filled with a rip-roaring soundtrack from M. M. Keeravani (try not to tap along), some memorable staging from cinematographer KK Senthil Kumar and the aforementioned action scenes directed by the brilliantly named King Solomon, RRR puts most big budget Hollywood affairs to shame with its unbridled enthusiasm and energy and even when the film gets bogged down in some less enjoyable moments that revolves mainly around Bheem's relationship with Olivia Morris's British Jennifer or some questionably crafted script work, RRR is never far away from another sequence that is likely to put a big smile on the viewer.Featuring a fully committed cast that is expertly lead by Rao Jr. And Teja, there's a good chance RRR isn't going to be suited to everyone's viewing preferences but if you jump on board for the wild ride, this is the perfect launch pad into the Bollywood scene with a film that is going to see Hollywood try and replicate its magic ingredients over the years to come.Final Say -Loud, brash, inventive and wildly fun, RRR is a fever dream of an epic that is hard to compare to anything else but should you be in the mood for something unashamedly fanciful and spectacle driven, RRR can't be beat.4 endlessly supplied quivers out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",8/10,positive
rajukumarnaidu-70400,"I have to try and review this without comparing it to anything directly because it's not comparable to other action blockbusters that have disappointed me recently. But I can say that this is how you do it right for large-scale, big-budget action movies. Hollywood isn't incapable of making movies that deliver excitement and emotion, but many pale in comparison to RRR. Again without pointing out any movies in particular (because I don't know what's directly comparable), Hollywood should take notes.RRR has many familiar tropes and beats you get out of historical epics/action movies, but it uses them well. Things we've seen on-screen dozens of times before can still be exciting and entertaining if they're used properly, and RRR is a testament to that.The amazing action is probably what stands out the most, but at its core, this film also has a really good story with heroes you want to see win and villains you want to see defeated. There's some extra conflict between the two main heroes for much of the movie, but ultimately it's a good vs evil story that's pretty straightforward and honest about that, and thanks to the great characters and strong performances, that ends up being enough.There's very little by way of slow scenes or dead air, and another reason the three-hour runtime flies by is that the action is so good. I complain a lot about lackluster action in modern action movies, so I was really happy to find that RRR does its action so well. Amazing stunts, great setups for the big set piece scenes, a level of brutality that makes you feel the impact of the combat (but not too much that it feels gratuitous), and a way of making things over-the-top in the best way possible (so not to the point where it feels like there are no rules or consequences for the good guys). The two main heroes in this are almost superheroes, which arguably makes RRR the best superhero film in years.Excellent stuff. A couple of lesser performances from minor characters and some occasionally clunky English dialogue from the British characters are all I could criticize it for, and they're nitpicks. This is a great action movie and an epic that more than warrants its three-hour runtime.",10/10,positive
austinashmore,"The movie is a mash up of whimsical over the top action and beautiful, well-paced storytelling. The movie begins with a song that spoils the movie, but the visuals and story male that null as you just have to continue watching. The use of cgi and wire-work blends in incredibly well. The idea that they both befriended their enemy due to being two powerful eccentric men doesn't feel forced. The onscreen chemistry between actors is fantastic. The ending is a surprise, to learn that the plan with the tiger (from 2 hours ago by that point) was to be used to disrupt a British party, and that the other character was not a bad person all along. It's how a twist ending should be. I am on my third watch-through of this movie and am just as interested as the first time.

In its buildup it sometimes was a bit confusing but by the big reveal you will be invested in the characters and hooked on their mission. Each scene is a work of art. From the opening credits I was riveted by the color, the speed, and the audacity of the special effects. Slow motion never looked so good. The main characters are larger than life, as bullet proof as Superman, and never stop moving. Bad guys are dispatched in greater numbers than any John Wick movie but in more ways than you can imagine. John Wick may have killed three bad guys with a pencil but the two heroes in RRR blew up a 100,000 sq. Ft. Building with a motor cycle and an arrow. Beautifully filmed, the movie builds to a glorious gut wrenching ending battle that would make any American blockbuster hide their head in shame. Its 3 hour and 5 minute length allows the plot to unfold slowly and deliberately but it never dragged. This Indian drama is an artistic masterpiece.

murlimohanrao,"To be brutally honest, all the hype around RRR made me apprehensive whether SS Rajamouli can deliver. I went into the theatre expecting a letdown, as the hype prior to release was reaching stratospheric levels.I was happy to be proven wrong when I watched the movie. The movie is a fictionalized tale of Alluri Seetharam Raju and Komaram Bheem, who though never met led potent revolutions in the early part of 20th century.The movie starts with a gut wrenching scene of the Governor and his wife visiting Adilabad for a hunting expedition. During that expedition, a tribal girl catches the attention of the governors wife (played by Allison Daddy) who is adept at skin paintings. She wishes to take the girl to their palace as a showpiece and the Governor willingly obliges. A few coins are thrown at the parents of the girl and she is whisked away. The tribals protest and obstruct the cavalry but they are brutally dealt with.This is where the audience is introduced to two parallel storylines. In the first storyline, Ramaraju (aka Ram Charan) is a police officer and is blindly siding with the monstrous actions of British to achieve a hidden agenda. In another storyline, Komaram Bheem (aka Jr NTR) is venturing into forests collecting wild animals like wolves and tigers. He is also masquerading as a mechanic at a garage in Delhi. His reason for presence is to get the girl kidnapped by the Governor back to her family.The story of these two characters then collides, they become great friends but are forced to go apart when their agendas collide. It would be a travesty to reveal anything more about the story.The storyline is thin, agreed ... but, the way the story is narrated on screen and intertwined with emotions makes it apart. This is exactly where Rajamouli delivers. While the visual spectacle is a given, it never loses track of emotions. That's exactly what makes this movie a potent entertainment experience. For e.g. The interval scene at the party is a visual delight but it also effectively packs the pain and frustration of losing the child to an oppressive government. The scene involving the climax fight is a visual delight but the fight has as much emotion behind it as action.Lots of directors can make visual spectacles but where they usually fail is the emotional quotient. Look at big budget disasters like Thugs of Hindustan, Kalank, 83 ...I would not like to say much on audio visual elements like sound, lighting, special effects because it is a given that they will be world class within the budget constraints. I would recommend this movie to any cinema lover. Just go blind and give in yourself to the experience.",9/10,positive

ollejeacock,"This movie is all I wanted it to be. The action. The action. The action. AND. The action. The characters are the best written I have ever seen and were very interesting plus VERY HOT! They both compliment each other so well and you can tell that their friendship is real, not just acting. Secondly, I would like to highlight the amazing choreography that was shown throughout the entire movie, from the first second I felt each and every hit they received and it felt so gosh darn real! For example, when General Scott leaped out of the car and took that last-second shot to flip the car was incredible and will go down in history as the greatest piece of cinematography EVER!!I'd also like to point out the INSANE CGI that went into this production every animal that I saw on screen looked so realistic and they felt so real. I would like to add the fact that this has inspired me to join the World of Warcraft club and I finally have the confidence to take a step into the real world to face my fears head-on.I enjoyed this more than Fortnite Chapter 3.",10/10,positive

Rajamouli has successfully showed the struggles of our freedom fighters in a fictional story.Loved the visuals storytelling. You see these heroes doing stuff without dialogue and I think that's why it connects perfectly to everyone. You don't really need dialogues to show the emotions.This is a emotional roller coaster that will make you cry and laugh. It is pure spectacle. It will take you on a ride to british india and it will show you not just how it was like but also how it felt like. Great acting by all actores.Great work by Ray Stevenson, RIP.",10/10,positive

vpraketh,"Bad story? Doesn't really matter as we knew this wasn't going to be a tale like bahubali 1, we knew this was going to contain action majoritily so I wouldn't say I was disappointed by the plot since I had no expectations
Coming to background score, the trailer had better background score than the movie, it was extremely underwhelming! Ram's entry scene in the trailer as alluri sita rama raju was pretty amazing and triumphatic but the actual scene was just disappointing asf since they changed the background score.Now coming to what the movie was all about , ""The Action"" I remember watching bahubali 2' s final sequence and couldn't stop sighing throughout the whole sequence even though I wasn't a movie geek but it was just bad but alright, the movie wasn't about the action but while watching RRR, I must say that I was sighing almost throughout the action sequences because they were just terrible! Emphasis on terrible
you can ignore logic in action movies but man this movie is unbearablly bad, the action sequences were straight out of a 2000s rajnikanth movie
I can't believe this trash is collecting so much money all over the world.It's kind of sinking the image of the quality of indian cinema possess!Over the past three-four years, we've got a lot of masterpieces from Bollywood, tollywood anf mollywood but RRR is the proof that we as a audience Haven't really changed our tastes in movies.I hate how people are defending this movie against the constructive criticism it has been receiving. Many say to ignore logic completely but why the exception just because the movie has been made by a particular director?A movie is a movie afterall, we should start judging a movie on the basis of how good it is and not on the basis of cast, directors etc.It was a disappointing experience and frustrating too.",2/10,negative

fostrhod,"Rise Roar Revolt"" RRR 2022. I have a confession, I have never ever seen a Bollywood film before, after hearing about this film from two friends, who can have a very critical view of the movies they watch both praised the film, admittedly one of these guys is known to lie through his teeth at times when overly praising anything. That said I decided to watch the film RRR.What I witnessed wasn't what I expected at all, from the opening in which to my eyes was quite brutal, and then the wide expanse of a colour palate in each and every frame. You'll soon realise that the film is essentially a glorious technicolour propaganda movie for the Republic of India and the demise of the British Empire. It's a Tarantino movie, set to a Bollywood score, with the good against evil of a Leone western. The British being the cruel and sadistic bad guys, with the oppressed Indian's rising against their oppressors. It's takes the struggle of two friends on opposing sides of the imperialistic divide to finally realise and combine to fight their oppressors. It doesn't sound like much fun but it is.This is the Tarantino comparison, fights scenes are beautifully choreographed and although there is so much blood and gore it is very much in the style of comic books.I will now have to do reading about the background to the movie. I have already made a mental note that there is a Netflix cartoon about a little muscle bound Indian baby boy called, The Mighty Bheem this can't be a coincidence. I also believe it was also nominated for an Oscar, foreign language I guess. It's a great film, one I watched in one sitting, much to the chagrin of my good lady wife. 9/10 you don't get much better.",9/10,positive

ryanpersaud-59415,"The Good: I don't think an Indian film has quite captured the film nerd imagination quite the way RRR has and for good reason. This movie - touted as the team up between Telugu superstars Rama Chao Jr., Ram Charan and director S. S. Rajamouli - feels more like an epic from yesteryear than a conventional historical action epic.The action scenes - of which there are so much it honestly makes Hollywood blockbusters seem conservative in comparison - are so wild and varied. Every single one ups the ante and we get such a nice variety as well; from fantastic martial arts choreography, tense firefights, bombastic one on one fights, chaotic action set pieces (featuring tigers, lots of tigers), RRR has it all. These scenes are insane most of the time, but so much that it's hard not to have a huge smile on your face.Music plays an important role in most Indian cinema, and here I think it's done as tastefully as it could be. The music is excellent, but not intrusive. It serves a good purpose and is well integrated into the storyline. And hell, the Desi Naach song is a legitimate banger I can't get out of my head.I was also surprisingly sold on the friendship between Bheem (Rama Rao) and Raju (Charan), whom (let's admit) become ""best friends"" as quick as Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly in Step Brothers. It's silly, but feels otherwordly at times, not a friendship, but a bond between two demigods destined to be in each other's lives. I think it works because of how fun the scene at the British party was; so much about their relationship is captured in this one scene.Speaking of the British, if anything really typifies the over the top nature of this film, it's how cartoonishly evil and moustache twirling they're depicted here. Not just oppressive, but gleefully oppressive. Not just wanted to instill fear in a conquered people, but thirsty for their blood and suffering. Not going to lie, it's a little weird. I'm not used to seeing any ""people group"" depicted in quite a way in American films, but if you think of this as more of a mythical Hindu epic than a (very loose) work of historical fiction, it makes more sense.The Bad: I think a lot of people give foreign films a pass sometimes, especially when they're coming from a country that viewer isn't familiar with, but as someone whose watched a lot of Indian films in my lifetime, I can say this: this movie is quite dumb at times. I know you're supposed to check your brain at the door and this is more emotive, mythical storytelling, but there were things that I couldn't help but bother me over the course of RRR.I also have to say, speaking of the British, it's immediately apparent within 5 minutes that none of these people are English. Their accents are laughably bad and honestly distracting (for an English speaker). Oddly, most of these actors are from the United Kingdom, but were mostly Irish or Northern Irish. (Perhaps they loved the opportunity to portray the British this way)There are also some issues with pacing and I wish the movie was cut down just a bit. Don't get me wrong, what's happening on screen is often incredible, but it did feel a bit one note after a while.The Ugly: RRR is a phenomenon for a reason. It's got everything - action, drama, romance, tragedy, music, comedy - it's probably the most purely cinematic experience you can get in 2022. It's also a testament to the South Indian film industry, long ignored in favour of Bollywood, but has now far exceeded India's former golden child. I genuinely look forward towards S. S. Rajamouli's stuff in the future. RRR is totally awesome.",8/10,positive
anishvarmaofficial,"Postives: Ntr , RamCharan intros and acting. Komuram bheemudo song/scene. Fights. Few vfx shots( interval zoo scene excluded). Ajay devgan plot is the only thing that belongs to what RRR actually is. British characters screen presence is good.Negatives: Poor story. Due to this, hardwork of the heroes and the emotions in scenes doesn't leave any impact. Music doesn't get into the head(naatu naatu is the first and last song/music that stays in mind when we remember about RRR which again is just for hype and not related to movie), biggest drawback is bgm. Scenes are not interesting and 3hr+ :0 (earliest show fans also got exhausted.) Poor vfx in some scenes and fights. Every few minutes heroes get their bones cracked and these are long long scenes of getting beaten for same old reason. Alia, Olivia and Shreya are for guest appearance. British characters had 30-40% of lines in the filmHeroes excelled , Director destroyed it.Movie is only for Hero's fans yet will have hard time about wether their hero got elevated or the other in each scene.As a neutral audience Ramcharan got good role/dialogues and the character itself is an elevation.Its mentioned as Fiction, else there is lot of flaws in the characters and is against the real freedom fighters ideology and life.Heroes get healed pretty soon and many more unnatural stuff .

Rajamouli is an edgy director who knows who knows how to entertain audience through an action with emotional writing. Jr. NTR, Ravi Teja, Both were fantastic, and you cannot imagine any other actors could have been better. Jr. NTR's emotions was the charm of the movie,Ravi Teja's acting was the blast of the movie.

grantss,"India, 1920. Due to the brutality of the British rulers, often unprovoked, callous and unnecessary, the Indian people are becoming restless and revolt is in the air. They need a leader and get one: Komaram Bheem. Out to get him is another Indian, Rama Raju, a fearless policeman with undying loyalty to the British government.I have long learned to ignore the IMDB ratings of Indian films: the sheer weight of Indian votes for films mean their rating is massively overstated. Yet this film seemed to have some potential. There's a lot of hype about this, not just in India, and the Oscar win for Best Original Song helped too.Yet, having now watched it, it really isn't any better than your average Bollywood offering. Plot is incredibly weak, filled with amateurish and implausible developments, predictable sub-plots and clumsy dialogue. Characters are incredibly badly drawn: all the British are heartless monsters, (almost) all the Indians are saints and/or heroes. Incredibly one-dimensional and lacking in nuance. The only interesting character was the Indian policeman, Rama Raju, as he was clearly conflicted in his role and it was interesting to see how his character pans out.Even the action scenes, which, considering the lack of substance of the film should have been the highlight of the film, are amateurish and over-stylised. So much slo-mo...Of course, being a Bollywood movie, there's also the inevitable song-and-dance segments, jammed in randomly, often at the most inappropriate times. This reduces the credibility of the plot even further and draws out the movie.On that note, this goes on for over three hours! Just getting halfway was a struggle: the movie seemed interminable!The production is lavish but that would be the only positive.",3/10,positive

RRR is not just a mass entertainer, but suffice to say that in depressing times, it remains one of the few positive points to feel proud as a Telugu guy and a film fan. The grandiose visual spectacle, the cinematography and the taking, the slow build-up backed by adrenaline pumping music, the Ramayana epic theme - all hallmarks of the director are extremely impressive. Ram Charan and Jr NTR stand out in their respective defining roles - iconic, flawless. The ensemble cast also dished out their best. A jam-packed theatre on a week day with crying babies, shouting fans and deeply immersed audience - for once it harked back to pre-covid times. I'd certainly watch the film again!",10/10,positive

singh-lalu503,"One word - Festival. That's how it felt like to watch this movie in theatre. More often than not audience would erupt in loud cheer, and that joy, whistling and cheer would go on for minutes.The movie is celebratory in so many ways - 1. Story is simple to follow, it's packed with emotion and action with some sprinkle of light laughter. Almost every element of story is tried and tested and have came out triumphant before. 2. Cinematography - Absolutely brilliant. I am not gonna mince words. But it's better than BB2. Senthil Kumar has only grown with every movie. 3. Action choreography - Again better than anything i have seen in an Indian Epic movies. It is also the biggest strength of the movie. Action so grandiose that it's gonna thrill you and fill you with cheer. 4- Music- Again absolutely brilliant - It's the music that sets the tone and atmosphere of the movie before the whole scene really kicks in. A few laps in the music here and there, but you might not notice that. 5. Acting - They were supposed to play superhuman with emotions of a normal human and they did it flawlessly.Honestly, there is nothing wrong with the movie, unless you want to pick on the holes that can only make your moviegoing experience bad. It's a celebratory movie and must be watched in same faith.Truly Epic.",10/10,positive

I am not that impressed with the macho supermen characters who can beat all the odds including a pouncing tiger.

mahatorohitkumar,"I finally got to watch RRR after a long wait yesterday since the film was streaming on Netflix. I logged off at work early in the evening, made myself two bowls of popcorn at home and streamed RRR on my laptop, completely detaching myself from the outside world because I was in much need of a break. At first, I thought I would get bored since the movie was more than three hours long but the way it captivates the attention of the audience, you won't feel that the film was stretched.The best part I liked about the film was the unpredictability. There are a lot of twists in the plot; someone you think is a bad person might end up being a good person. The movie had a good storyline and was brilliantly portrayed on screen. After all, it's a SS Rajamouli film and having watched Bahubali, I knew I won't be disappointed watching RRR.The best part of Rajamouli's films is that the main characters play a role larger than life. Set in pre-independent India, the movie revolves around two young men, each with their own motive to fight again the British meets each other, and become the best of friends till one of them reveals their secrets and gets betrayed. The film takes a sharp turn after that and some more secrets are revealed; you would basically need to watch it for yourself to understand the plot twists.While giving the movie all the credits where it is due, at some parts, I feel that it was over-dramatic. For example, a venomous snake bites one of the main heroes, Rama and it is said that he would die in 24 hours because there are no known antidotes. A man from the same village gives the antidote to Rama just the next minute and in less than five minutes, he becomes fit and is ready to fight. In another scene, Bheema receives whiplash for conspiring against the British Government and he is seen bleeding and exhausted from the beatings but the next moment, the scars vanish and he is fit again. The way the main characters magically recover from any injury within a few minutes is something really funny but I guess that's how movies work!",10/10,positive
thatleoguy,Impressive story telling. Indian movies are amazing on how much they can fit in . At 3 hours American movies would need a trilogy and at least 8yrs to fit in as much as this film did. Just the intro to the movie is 40 minutes before you see the title. Very well done. Obviously a fictitious story but very well done. 10 10 recommend. Overall production and actors did a great job .

jujare11-126-340921,"It's hard for a filmmaker to deliver another blockbuster after delivering a blockbuster franchise. S. S. Rajamouli, who became a pan-India star director after the Baahubali franchise, did it. There is no doubt that Rajamouli creates larger-than-life characters and scenes that have an impact on the mind's of the audience even after many years. In the case of RRR, it can be said that Rajamouli was successful at achieving the same once again.Direction: Rajamouli should be appreciated for coming up with a story that keeps the audience hooked despite being three hours-long. His choice of actors and technicians lived up to his expectations. Ram Charan's and Jr. NTR's introduction scenes and the interval bang scene can create an impact on the audience and encourage other filmmakers to think out of the box.Acting: Ram Charan and Jr. NTR electrified the screen with their presence. Rajamouli was successful in utilising the Stars who otherwise are not known for their acting skills. Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt were decent and roped in more for commercial reasons rather than for their acting skills. British actors Olivia Morris, Ray Stevenson and Alison Doody acted decently.Cinematography: K. K. Senthil Kumar did a great job at capturing larger-than-life scenes such as Ram Charan's and Jr. NTR's intro and the interval bang.Music: The BGM composed by M. M. Keeravani adds more depth to the scenes such as Ram Charan's and Jr. NTR's intro and the interval bang. All songs are situational but don't have much impact on the audience.Writing: The story is a fiction based on real-life freedom fighters Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana respectively. It is set during the British period in India in 1920. It has two plots. One plot revolves around Alluri Sitarama Raju who works as a police officer for the Britishers. He is on a mission to fulfil his Dad's dream of arming Indians using British arms. Another plot is about a tribal man named Komaram Bheem who is on a mission to free his sister Malli from Britishers. The story is all about the two freedom fighters who unexpectedly meet and help each other to fulfil their respective missions. Vijayendra Prasad (story), Sai Madhav Burra (dialogues) and S. S. Rajamouli (screenplay) did a great job by writing the complex story by combining these two plots.Editing: When you feel that you have understood a film completely without any confusion, then you should appreciate the editor for his efforts. A. Sreekar Prasad made sure that each and every scene in the film is clearly understood through smooth transition from shot to shot.",8/10,positive
kolliyathi,RRR is one of the best film. The way SS Rajamouli narrated the story is completely another level. Ram charan and NTR performed their level best.

A 'love interest' between a posh colonialist lady and an Indian (he is no looker) when they can't even communicate with each other. Really? Over-long. Horribly blinkered view that all English are 'baddies' (apart from the posh colonialist lady of course). An early scene where a loan Indian soldier beats off 5,000 Indian rebels sets the tempo. It's a film for small children. The film ends in a similarly manner. Top tip for authenticity, one man with a bow and arrow probably can't take on 200 heavily armed troops. Endless 'action' scenes. Could easily have taken an hour off of the runtime. I honestly couldn't make out if the film was very subtly sending itself up or not. Apparently not.

But at the starting, fight sequence of ramcharan against literally thousands people has blown my mind and the reason that fight was beleivable. I never seen anything like that not even in Hollywood. It amped up my expectations for this movie.Visuals in this movie was mind blowing. SS rajmouli is not only a great filmmaker but a true artist.Only complaint that I have with this movie was the absence of a strong villain.but the best part about this movie is that It never compromise the experience of the movie. I only felt that in the end when there was no strong antagonist against the lead heros. Otherwise it could have been a perfect epic movie.The acting by ramcharan and jr.

avavedam,"The long wait has ended with the release of SS Rajamouli' magnum opus 'RRR' . Not only has it surged the value for multiplex' stocks, but has also managed to mint coins with ease. Though in the first few hours of its release there has been a fruitless effort by , perhaps North Indian losers or perhaps jobless pricks I reckon. The movie is set in pre - Independence era of British Raj in India and revolves around Komaram Bheem from Adilabad and Alluri Sita Rama Raju from Visakhapatnam agency area.The story begins with a little girl of gond tribe who's forcefully snatched from her tribal parents who are naive and unaware of the ways of Evil British Empire. On the other hand A. Rama Raju , working in the imperial police force strives to prove his loyalty to the empire. But why? That forms the crux of the story. There's not a scene you'd want to miss. Every frame has been crafted with utmost care and love for art , be it the 1920s New Delhi , the costumes or the vibe of colonial era as a whole. Little touch of humour that has been added does the job well without making it seem like an awkward retrofit as in the case of Radheshyam. The humour episode does a really good job in aiding the story. Portrayal of a naive yet determined Komaram Bheem by NTR is impeccable. I doubt if you could stop yourself from, atleast tapping your foot during NAATU NAATU song. Such is the music and choreography-- Electrifying!! If bromance had to have a synonym it would be bromance of Rama Raju and Bheem . Those who brag about Chandler and Joe from friends, it's time your so called "" bromance"" leave the Dias. When things seem cool in the first half, you shall witness a mind-blowing interval face off between the duo, the VFX are too notch. This scene would clarify why there was a tiger in the trailer. Like every other SS Rajamouli' film , here you'll be left with a gripping interval sequence.Post interval, the film gets a step higher. Oh how could I forget such brilliant performance by Ram Charan who was once ridiculed as ' wooden face '. In most of the scenes, it was his eyes that acted and oh boy! They would make you cry. He delivered his best to project the moral dilemma experienced in punishing his own friend and the realisation which , at a later stage causes a metamorphosis. Though some self proclaimed critics have cried about less screen time for Alia ( RamaRaju's love interest ) and Ajay Devgan, I'd gracefully show them a finger to assure how worthless their opinions are. Rajamouli has reached a new level of perfection when it comes to paying attention to minute details, be it the use of light and shadowsl as an aid in story telling , symbolism in the second & bits of first half and using elements of nature to set the theme for a character or a scene in general. Well this bit is something that Kurosawa and Hayao Miyazaki have been known for, so far, but now I take pride in saying SS Rajamouli has made his own mark in this sphere. His method of story telling is beyond impressive and way beyond any Indian director could ever get close to. The climax is a complete theatre experience and here, my fellow men and women, SSR has put all his talent, skill to glue audience to the screens. One can't help but rejoice with tears of pride, happiness crawling down their cheeks as Rama Raju in his full attire, guerrilla gear and Bheem take down the British troops in a sequence that will leave you at the edge of the seats. Background score is a big add on, & every track fits the situation. As mentioned previously, SSR has upgraded his game. One could fall short of words to review this film any further. A humble request to those watching it in theaters -- sit back for the post credits scene.PS: SS Rajamouli is the king, torch bearer of Indian Cinema. And if there's any self proclaimed king kha.... Errr , stay put kid!!",10/10,positive

dark_pheonix_03,"RRR is the real pride of Indian cinema as it bettered in many aspect from BAHUBALI which is another masterpiece from the same Director SS. Rajamouli. Both stars Jr. NTR and RC gave their best to the movie. Their bromance in the movie is excellent and the real friends couldn't have the bromance as the both Jr. NTR and RC had in movie. Jr. NTR is a terrific actor and all of us knows about it and he did as usually fantastic but surprise package is RC and the debutant Olivia Morris. The chemistry of Olivia as Jenny and Jr. NTR as Bheem is EYE FEAST. The cameos of Alia and Ajay Devgan are short but impactful. Jr. NTR did a God level acting in a song KOMURAM BHEEMUDO just with his eyes. The technical crew done a fantastic job like Cinematography , GOD LEVEL BGM, Art designing, Direction ,CGI, Costume designing. Overall the film is a answer to the world about creativity and storytelling of Tollywood. The action sequences and the interval is breath taking. Expecting a sequel for this master piece.",10/10,positive

Ajay Devgan's cameo was a good one. Highly recommended to everyone.",10/10,positive
dirkbennett,"Not sure I watched the same film as the majority of reviewers here?! This felt like cobbled-together and made-up as they went along, suitable possibly for an audience of 5-year old over-excitable children. Apart from a laughable storyline the characters so cardboard they hardly would stand up on their own. And even though I'm not British myself, I found the handling of the conflict and its parties, especially in view of today's discussions, utterly imbalanced, following the simple scheme: British=white=evil, and Indian=brown=good. Ridiculously overplayed, yes, but not made in good taste and left a bad flavour. Just imagine the uproar, if a modern Western film were to steep to such stereotypes.",1/10,negative

manishrvce,"Finally watched S. Rajamaoulis's grand epic blockbuster-RRR on Netflix India. I am sure most of you might have already watched this mega actioner set in the British era, but I would still like to give my views on this. I know many film fans and critics loath Manoj Kumar's mega hit-Kranti(which I anyway love) for being loud, over the top and showing Britishers as brute animals, I want to point out that RRR goes further and is really very loud and melodramatic as far as treatment is concerned. It also is in the mould of great Telugu films wherein canvas is very important. I found traces of Kranti and even other 80s Mard, Desh Premee, Sarfarosh(Jeetendra one which itself was a remake of NTRs Telugu film) of course on a much bigger canvas. In spite of shortcomings and going a bit haywire here and there, RRR still delivers a SOLID punch. Rajamoulis's penchant for showing action makes RRR one of the best action films in India. Both Ram Charan and NTR Jr. Nail their roles perfectly. Ajay Devgan is great in his cameo but I didn't like Alia Bhatt. Overall a full-on enjoyable grand actioner, though I would say I preferred Bahbulai-1 and 2 over it!",8/10,positive

It means that 2% of whole population of India , 76.85% were Sikhs. Didn't see a brave Sikh man in the movie. Showing lush green tropical forest outside Delhi was so bland.

Bahubali was a spectacle that worked out due to the star caste Prabhas, Anushka and Rana. They add to the glory, while RRR had to try hard to imitate and artificially create that glory with this star cast.I will not reveal the twists, suggest every one to watch the movie just for Rajamouli and the poor producer that had put so much money trusting the project.",1/10,positive

politicidal,"Overblown yet riotously entertaining action romp courtesy of Indian director S. S. Rajamouli.Its two Bollywood leads are very cool as they effortlessly use their martial arts skills to take out dastardly Brits or punch a tiger with a flaming torch. Speaking of which, the action scenes in this movie are crazy and over the top. But you'll have a blast watching it. Fists go flying, cars and buildings explode, there's motorcycle stunts, a one-vs-hundred brawl, and even a big melee involving tigers, leopards, and wolves.The set-pieces are grandly absurd but showcase Rajamouli's eye for big budget spectacle. Hollywood needs to take a few cues from this guy.It does clock at a mammoth three hours but the friendship between the two protagonists keeps things watchable when there's no fights going on. There's even a big dance battle just to lighten the mood that's a lot of fun.Special mention to Ray Stevenson and Alison Doody hamming it up as the villains. Stevenson is chewing the scenery while Doody looks like she has not had this much fun since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.",8/10,negative

m-divyaa,I watched RRR in Tamil. I thought Bahubali was Rajamoulis best and he cant repeat the same magic again. Went in without any expectations and was blown away. So many goosebump moments. I rarely watch Telugu movies. Mostly I watch Tamil and Malayalam movies. This is the first time I'm watching Ram Charan and Taraks movie. I knew they were good dancers but in this movie they did exceptional acting. Their hardwork literally translates to the screen. Quite impressed with the story and screenplay. There was not one dull moment throughout. But few scenes were too violent for me to watch especially the public whipping of Tarak. First half fully I was rooting for Tarak. Second half I was rooting for both Tarak and Ram. The supporting cast Aliya and Ajay Devgan did complete justice to their roles. Aliya is a great actress and I wish she does more movies down south. Overall Paisa wasool movie. Will definitely watch again in theaters.,10/10,positive

Sure they were probably no angels, like most of colonial powers who abused their powers.Looks too fake to me. I guess a huge success with simple minds. Seing the good rating here makes me wonder how easy it is to put a movie on top of a list if you have me enough people in that category (from India). Sorry, but you need to be a little more self-critic.It's not because it's a 3h Indian movie from a famous director, that it's a good movie. Some decent actors of course. Some funny moments. Way too much impossible action scenes, but that is something we had to expect. The music was good I must admit.Decors and all, nice. But it does not save the rest.",1/10,positive

dreamydesires,"I see many positive reviews, and I'd like to second them-this movie was, honest to God, one of the best I've seen in a while. I loved the acting, the story, the friendship dynamic, the cast, the diversity, and seriously, I could go on. I'm guessing that the people who rated this low did so for one of three reasons: not enough romance, ""basic"" storyline, or they just wanna be different. Contrary to popular belief, I kinda liked that the focus of the story was not on romance, and in my opinion, that's what made this movie stand out from the rest. Just to clarify: there is romance, it's just not the main focus of the movie. I'm not going to give away any spoilers, but trust me, if you're kinda bored, and you wanna check out a movie with an interesting plot, action with a sprinkle of romance, and with an amazing cast, you most likely won't be disappointed.Edit : The reason I didn't give RRR a 10/10 is simply because the pacing seemed a bit slow at times.

azemillancy,"The movie ran well in the box office, collected a whopping 1,115 crore rupees, became Top 5 in Netflix US. A global sensation that is much hyped and successful in getting high ratings in many online movie review and rating platforms.When I watched the film in theatre, I felt goosebumps covering all over my skin. The experience felt indescribably great. But still it seems the movie isn't a great one.Visual Effects and Direction are all top-notch, one of the best in Indian Commercial Cinema. But something that is really necessary for a film to be good is a well-written screenplay, and that's what the film lacks horribly. The story is very weak and shallow that the director made all the aesthetic dependent on the breathtaking visual effects, larger-than-life protagonists and over-the-top action scenes.The action scenes are all well-shot and pulsating, and the defiance of physics doesn't have to be taken into consideration.Also at the same time, the most significant problem of the film lies here too. At the end of the film, it seemed like the whole movie was made only to be a gallery for action scenes. The exaggerated action scenes, even though they are good to watch, doesn't have a good story to be attached with. The story is too weak that it cant even be considered a story.Two guys form a friendship, later on splits apart and forms the friendship once again, and fights for their aim together. If I go for a better detailing it will end up in spoilers. The two lead characters are also resembled with historical and mythological characters, but even that wasn't given any proper writing. The lack of depths in characters and weak conflicts are the main problems that could be seen in the screenplay.It's a movie on a budget of 550 crores, but the story is not something that satisfy spending on that scale. And it's an SS Rajamouli film, the magnificence of his previous films like Baahubali is explicitly missing in RRR mainly due to the apparent lack of quality in the screenplay.Whatever it is, the film is still a watchable one. The visual effects and action scenes does the job of making the viewer stay focused on the screen till the end. But still, those VFX stunts are all just instant gratification, not something of good artistic value.",5/10,positive

AaronCameron10741,"RRR is GOOD. Let's get the over-the-top stunts out of the way- and leave a little logic aside (the reason for a 9 and not 10).RRR, a great tale of two friends uses literary devices like dramatic irony to another level, the plot devices are just great. The writing is so underrated since the direction is so good. The set ups and payoffs are brilliant, the writing/progression of action sequences (very unique too) and the scenes progression is world class. Just a few flaws like the movie being too plot oriented (the snake biting Ram, Bheem meeting Seetha, etc.) makes the movie too convenient but the emotion overpowers it all. The movie blinds you with emotion... The dosti song is so well shot and foreshadows the whole film, the symbols like the maala Bheem gave Ram to recover, then Ram using the same maala to capture him or the use of the song Naatu Naatu's beats to find each other. May it be these or any other works so well and blends with the emotion so well.The song Bheem sings in front of the entire crowd moves you, it progresses the characters so well making it even more powerful.What can I say, SS. Rajamouli is a THEATRICAL director and I will never get bored of rewatching RRR.Lastly, the score is outstanding. The way it progresses and evolves with the story, and not to mention the emotion with the grandeur makes it even better. The instruments used in situations elevates the scenes so much and saves the slightly cringy/predictable reactions in some places.Watch RRR on Netflix now!",9/10,positive

zeeshanabid,"I agree this is not Baahubali. There are numerous holes and logical errors in the story. And the super-human strength is much lesser acceptable as the characters belong to a time around 70 years ago, rather than about 1000 years ago. But the movie still delivers what it promises. There are numerous exotic and creative fight scenes and there is also a heart clenching emotional drama. It's a very stylish movie actually, and if you like such movies, you might even love it. Just don't compare it to Baahubali. Masterpieces like Baahubali are delivered once in several decades.Let me clarify something. This movie is not about freedom fighting against British Empire. Although this concept is present in the story, the central theme is about two people's interactions. They are both extremely strong and powerful. Sometimes they are friends and sometimes they are enemies. Very good fighting scenes are created involving them, either when they are friends or enemies. This is the entire focus of the movie. Although at times I felt this concept could have been explored far better, and the movie could have improved, I still can't say it's a bad movie. Rating of 8 stars seems reasonably to me, as there are currently way too many pretty bad Indian movies are rated even above 8. This movie is surely far better than those.",8/10,positive

kharisha,"Basically there is no such a big story here, but keeping one incident and making it 3 hr long movie with few flash backs is really art, only rajamouli has mastered that.Its really treat to watch the wonderful sets, forest scenes action scenes etc. Not to be compared with Bahubali as each movie is different with respect to story, budget & narration.Once the movie reaches climax you will have feel of what a wonderful experience, and it is like treat for movie lovers comes once in a while.For me the best part is Climax song, where in all our pre independent hero's show cased and has covered almost all states, till date we are made to believe only one person is responsible for our independence, but this is like the real story of our independence where we missed all these days, Hats off to Rajamouli, Keep up the good work.",8/10,positive
imsirabhishek,This is a movie made on a grand scale and has taken quite a bit of time and money to make which is something that has been missing in Indian cinema for a while. The move does not have any complex story line or mind blowing twists if you are looking for that than you might be disappointed but what the movie has is excellent production quality with great direction and supreme background scores.

This kind of films has to be made in Indian Cinema because it's not a film it is an emotion for Every Indian and represents the Indian (Southern Part) Culture very beautifully and no westernization was there. For me best film of the time and gives the same film as expected from Rajamouli sir's films. For me RRR full form is Rajamouli, Ram Charan, NTR. Rama Rao.",10/10,positive

Why can't we as Indians make movies with more substance with these kind of budget with good logic. Why do these stupid make belief movie are being celebrated. Our taste is better than this. I really can't tell whether its Fantasy movie or whether we need take things seriously. How is this an action/drama movie? Then what do you call movies like Die Hard with good writing? Just drama. Rajamouli also never even tries to hide the fact that he straight away copies scenes and screenplay formulas from big Hollywood movies already worked well. No words to describe how dumb the movie is.

advaithrsn,"""RRR"" is majestic, glorious, over-the-top but you are sure to be entertained!As someone who never liked like over-the-top action sequences, I was at the edge of the seat every time a fight scene would come. The action sequences may not (or probably never) make sense, but it is driven by emotions, and that is why I just did not care.Ram Charan and NTR are the buddies of this year. I don't think anything can come close to friendship of these two on screen. SS Rajamouli of course has his trademark signature scenes, driven by passion and emotion rather than physics or science. The CGI, VFX and cinematography were Marvel level to be honest, with gorgeous set designs and lot of attention to details. MM Keeravani gave one of the best scores of this year, with unforgettable songs, and the epic dance number 'Naatu Naatu'.A full-fledged action packed entertainer that will never bore you for a second.

Well didn't think much of it as a drama/action film, did laugh out a few times at the absurdity - ""Heroes"" literally vibrating to show some kinda emotion(?), Terrible cgi to cover up footwork in dances, and the arrow hand grenade.Such an interesting premise, ruined by the usual over the top macho nonsense. Not much depth to the characters, even though they give them backstories. Actresses there for the sake of it, the cgi tiger could have done their part. Cool sets though.Maybe if I didn't go by the reviews and just saw the film I'd like it for what it is, just like a superhero film.

NTR And Ram Charan's Acting: Their bond makes it one of the reasons to watch the movie again.The Screenplay: They Have Shown The Movie In Such a way that it makes up for its lack in the story.The Songs: The Songs are EPIC. JUST EPIC. MM Keeravani has done an excellent job.The Action Scenes: This Is a Rajamouli standard film with intense but thrilling action scenesThe Bonding Between Charan And NTR Is a reason to watch the movie again.Cons:
The Other Cast: Rajamouli has given primal importance to NTR and Charan that he has forgotten the other cast.The Story: It Says that Charan's character struggles for 15 years to just get guns for the people of the country. He could have just led a revolution, and that would have been better.Also, The 2nd part was a drag as he needed to make up for the story.Overall, an A and 9.5 out of 10.",10/10,positive

vikasbhandari2,"I just re-activated my account to post this review. I went to watch this movie after seeing 9.1 rating. I mean, 9.1? Seriously???There is no story line, just some patches which are tried at best to be patched together.Just fighting, fighting and fighting. Some special effects, and our love to RRR. That's it. Nothing else in the movie.It is not worth 2 star, let alone 9. Very poor direction, and stretched the movie for no reason.Movie started with a bang with Ram's excellent performance obeying orders to arrest a man standing among 1000 of mobs, but then it got weaker and weaker. The fights, scenes, actions and events just defy physics and obvious-ism.This movie MAKES NO SENSE.If you are someone who follows the Movies like Antim or Radhey, you will probably like this movie because it is just fighting without any logic or requirements. But If you are someone who likes good movies, with a good storyline, and excellent direction, please don't go watch this. VERY VERY VERY POOR.And what is more disgusting is that there are 1000s of fake reviews marking it a 9.1 rating movie. What is happening guys.......",2/10,negative

kcrateau,"This was the very Best of Bollywood! I don't always love Indian movies because the dialogue can come off cheesy in my opinion, but I think most of it gets lost in translation. This was a great movie for its storyline for its action sequences for it's dancing and it's music track. I will admit I didn't want to go much further than 30 minutes in, but stick with this movie and it will give you a whole other perspective on what an action film can look like from a different nation. Those who want to pick on the plot flaws and the unrealistic details should go watch American hero movies and tell me that the super powers and their amazing healing ability are innately some American movie trope that can't be used by others. I didn't quite get the timing and flashbacks but it all made sense by the end. My only issue was that Rahj Started the movie has some bad ass who could take on a whole mob of thousands by himself but then seemed to be somewhat human for most of the movie and then came back as the bad ass in the last 30 minutes. Overall i'd tell anyone to watch this movie For a few hours of enlightenment of another cultures movie scene and to just enjoy some breathtaking cinematography.",9/10,positive

shawshank22-567-629684,"I'm ignorant of the Bollywood movie scene, so I'm speaking about this movie from a mostly Western film background. Hoo does this movie put spectacle over all else to extremely entertaining effect. The bridge scene alone probably makes this worth a peek. So ridiculous, but so great. Who doesn't love a good movie bromance.In between all these wonderfully outlandish showstopper set pieces is some very simplistic yet contrived plotting, plus awkward, awkward, campy performances. The heightened, gonzo drama between our two male leads is just ultimately deflated by a lot of poor pacing and exhausting cliches. Cartoonish villainy from the British colonists probably being the most egregious, but that romance between the lead and nice white lady is woof, tough to sit through.If you're one who enjoys camp, this is one to check out. Camp beyond belief. I do have friends who loved it, but this one was not for me.",4/10,positive

The precise deployment of extras to maintain weightage of story. The usage of props matching to the timeline is right at notch. The dynamics of CGI animals is well managed. The negative character's importance is highlighted in both main character's back story.The move is just perfect, yeah in one particular part, CGI is given up, apart from that ....

norbert-plan-618-715813,"The aesthetics of Tollywood films (and many other Indian cinematographies) are in full effect here: actors and actresses constantly overacting, no real sound recording and the sound is reworked unrealistically in the studio (the voices are ridiculous), the bad guys are very bad (and English, the bad guys back up a ton to show they're bad), the good guys are very good, use of slow motion in the action sequences, unsynchronized dubbing during the singing passages (which are distracting), ridiculous moments (the dance contest, or the montage sequence with song about the friendship between the two main characters), ultra-redundant and insistent dialogue, an inability to tell a story through direction, excessive use of CGI porn with no concern for realism (at times, it's a cartoon aesthetic: the tiger sequence, or the series of explosions at the end). Another element that abstracts the film from all realism is the physical abilities of our two main characters, which are unbelievable and worthy of a superhero, or rather that of a super-heroic character who fears nothing.Ram Charan as Raju, who has a secret quest that we gradually come to understand, especially late in the film. It's a charismatic role.N. T. Rama Rao Jr. As Bheem, whose quest is clear from the start of the film. He is searching for and must bring back the little girl the English have taken from his village.As usual, the female characters are a dime a dozen. Here we have Alia Bhatt, her husband's enforcer. And Olivia Morris, who plays the only English character who is not excessively caricatured.But the film does contain some terrific sequences, such as the capture of the tiger, or the sequence of the bridge and the train bursting into flames.",9/10,negative

* Acting - superb acting by Ramcharan and Jr NTR. We can clearly see the energy they shown in the Nato Nato song.* Action - Action scenes are phenomenal.* BGM - Background music is amazing.Negative -

dineshpalakkad-00735,"As a big fan of Bahubali 1, and an even bigger fan of Bahubali 2, I had a lot of expectations going into RRR. I wasn't expecting another magnum opus, but I was expecting a gripping story, replete with incredible screenplay, clever action sequences and a fair share of twists and turns in the plot. RRR fails to deliver on all counts.I don't even know where to begin. Rajamouli takes too much time introducing the protagonists - the Fire and the Water analogies are meaningless and poorly concocted. One cannot but help wonder if all that wasted time in the movie could not have been used to develop a more interesting plot. The protagonists themselves are so bad in every respect that I can't even remember their character names in the movie. Compare that to the like Kattappa and Bhalla and Sivakami in Bahubali or even the relentless Fly in Naan Eee, and you soon run out of leeway. There is a weak attempt at justifying underdeveloped ideologies for the two main archetypes in the movie, and it is so poorly developed that it fails to hit the spot.The plot meanders along aimlessly from one boring scene to another, with random characters weaving in and out like caricatures in a bad comic book. There is a scene where NTR gets to take a crack at a cop who unnecessarily roughs him up in an earlier sequence. Knowing Rajamouli, I was expecting more impact in that scene, but it was so predictable and poorly delivered, that it failed to leave any impression whatsoever.There is an even weaker attempt in the movie at rekindling a romance, which goes nowhere - neither is it interesting, nor is it likeable. And the flashbacks are pathetic attempts to justify pointless ideologies that they are only a distraction in the movie, and best forgotten sooner rather than later. Characters like Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt have been thoroughly wasted, as are Shriya Sarin and Samuthrakani.The music is ok, and the cinematography is ok, but the most important ingredient in any movie, the lowest common denominator, so to speak, is the story and the plot, and as hard as he has tried to piece something together in RRR, Rajamouli has failed miserably.In sum, I would not recommend wasting your time on this movie. I hope the director finds his way again, and makes a compelling comeback in his next flick.Thanks for reading!",2/10,negative
cbss-98543,"RRR is yet another masterpiece produced by SS Rajamouli. The way Rajamouli extracts such an indulging movie from a small plot with such perfection is a treat to watch from beginning till end.

bartom-612-185848,"Do not read any further, just do yourself a favor and watch the movie in your nearest Cinema Hall.RRR: A movie about 2 circumstantial friends, working their way for opposing mission. As their backstory unfolds, their friendship transcends further and working in unison for the greater good. The movie lead by NTR Jr. (Bhim) and Ram Charan (Sitarama aka Ram) with great supporting roles from Ajay Devgan, Alia Bhatt and Samuthirakani.From the trailers, we ought to know that we are getting into a Baahubali-style grandeur, coupled with sans-logic fights. That is the only limitation that your brain needs to adjust and enjoy this well-directed marvel. Am sure this is something we have seen many movies from top actors in south in so-called action movies. So, it is easier to expect and move on.This movie follows the traditional way of story telling and creates a premise which is rather memorable. This is a commendable effort from the director in this age of filming, where everything is fast forward in the name of modernization of film editing. The explanation of each ""R"" of the movie is very crisp and punchy that you buy into the characters Bhim and Ram. Needless to mention; they will occupy 85% of screen space and you completely back who you are rooting for and for what reason.NTR Jr and Ram Charan already have a huge fan base and their lineage is just bigger than the Tollywood cinema itself. Despite this, the effort put in by both the actors and their physical transformation to look slick on their roles is commendable. That is what gives a true grit to the movie and gives us a commitment to immerse ourselves in the character and walk alongside them in their quest for success.The second half does slow down, and it is fair that way, as the first half has just been just a colossal rampage of information and due spectacle of brilliances from the actors. To maintain that pace is surely not needed and when we deep dive into the backstory of how things were, you will feel the justification behind Ram Charan and why he is reacting the way he is reacting in the movie. You buy into it very easily.You don't have to understand Bhim and his motto, his rescue mission is a testimonial to the fact how clans prioritize others than self and how they are willing to throw anything and everything to save lives. Although annexation was at full swing in the British rule, the movie takes focuses on human trafficking and the emotions that run along with it.Sometimes, this movie did show glimpses of Captain America, Civil War. Not in the superhero characteristics, but whose side the audience will sway based on the circumstances and if you haven't swayed between Ram and Bhim then you are soul deprived 😊.Ajay Devgan, Alia Bhatt, Samuthirakani have justified their screen time and delivered the message where needed. Kudos on director to use them in right place at the right time. Normally in such movies, songs would drag the pace down, not here though. The songs are equally adrenaline rushed as the movie itself. Dance movements were just breathtaking, especially ""Nattu Kuthu"". You will involuntarily be dancing from your seats, its too good..
Although it would have been better off without one Sad song.Surely every movie has flaws, and this is no exception, but the question is can you look past them? Yes absolutely. Can you enjoy the movie even with them? 100%.RRR just Roars!!",8/10,positive

vougiersama,"A cinematic slap in the face like few others. A truly beautiful blockbuster with virtuoso action scenes, which also contains many underlying themes, particularly political and nationalistic. While the latter can be heavy-handed in American films, they stand out here in that they revolve around a formerly colonized country, which for my part I know very little about, so it feels refreshing.The bromance between the two male leads is absolutely invigorating, and exudes an intensity that is only seen in a heteronormative setting in Western productions.The mastery of the fights and their editing is insane, and proves that it would be totally conceivable to properly adapt shonen manga for the cinema.To top it all off, the dances and music are incredible too, and adhere to the narrative more organically than traditional musicals.The three-hour running time is hardly noticeable, which is quite a feat for an action film with a rather straightforward synopsis. I do have one criticism, however: the third act is clearly weaker than its predecessors, serving only as an obvious tunnel to the happy, sing-song conclusion. A potential masterpiece, which I'll be delighted to revisit.",8/10,positive

Excellent movie.Perhaps the best part in in the first half an hour, when you are introduced to the two protagonist, and see what they can do. Those scenes are both great, with another superb encounter when they meet, and without a word plans how to save a stranded boy trapped in a fire in the river(!).

The dramatic slowmotion, sing & dances, you'll find it everywhere especially the slowmo BUT SOMEHOW the RRR team manage to change every 'bad' stereotypical because i couldn't find any unnecessary slowmo, but I found a lot of breathtaking scene & plot instead! I missed lots of details by checking my phone for few second so i don't recommend it 😂 it's worth your 3h5mins i swear!It's just the dubbing that happened to not match the mouth movement that bothers me a bit (i searched and found that it was dubbed on several dialect?

vedant-78536,"Engaging movie from start to finish! 😍😍😍😍😍😍 Actors acted very well. Everybody! From Jr. NTR to Alia Bhatt! The characters were well-written. Both the male leads were outstanding, but the character of Rama Raju (played by Ram Charan) was the best-written out of the two as his character is more emotionally-complex. Not a single dull moment. Only one hiccup though:- When Rama Raju starts killing the Britishers in a rejuvenated form as Lord Ram despite being severely injured only a few moments ago.",10/10,positive

Most f the people blame the story but the essence of Rajamouli is small story - big scale, he follows this in every one of his movie.Talking about technical stuff -PLOT

Both Rama Raju and Bheem's Entry.Also the scene they both met to save the kid.Most anticipating part of movie for me is Komuram bheemudo song. That really reminded the freedom struggle, fighting spirit of Indians and slavery awareness. Literature like poetry played a major role in freedom struggle and it is perfectly combined in this movie. This is the best scene of bheem for me but Rama raju didnt get equal scene in this . But dont know why people said Rama raju character dominated! Both the characters had their own Strengths.I thought Bheem hunting the wild animals only to eat but pre Interval scene brought huge surprise.Last song about our freedom fighters is superrr ending :)Ramaraju preferring helping bheem's aim than the word he gave to his father is really good point because his father's indirect aim is freedom.Sacrificing scenes by friends around Interval scenesMinus:
During Naatu naatu song, Britisher said their variety of dances but both heroes shown them mass dance: Is there nothing in Indian dances other than mass dance? Kuchipudi,Bharathnatyam,Kathakali and almost each classical dance per two states on average. This could be the movie that rehype our traditional dances.During mid of the movie, should say too much of action scene or less dialogues scene. An important communication is missing between the friends. But may be there could be no story if face to face dialogue scene happen.The point of being a police under british rule is irrelevant and also the aim of Ramaraju is also looked needless stuff. Guns, Rifles, and culverin are not only Weapons. Stones were sharpened to use as weapon those days. At climax we saw bow and arrow which was highly used as weapon in out puranas. Mace was also a weapon but dont why rajamouli wants to highlights guns as only weapon.Few of Goosebumps Climax fight scenes already displayed in trailer makes me predictable about climax scenes and not much surprising the way they faced challenges at that points.Rajamouli showed the brutality of British rulers,police or bullying britishers that time but the revenge didnt look that satisfying even at climax. Should have been scenes were Rulers were scared. Few scenes like Indians terrorizing Britishers could have been satisfying.",10/10,negative

They will stun you with their screen presence and bromance which is the biggest highlight of the film. Adding to this, the patriotic drama that is showcased makes RRR quite intense. Rajamouli once again proves that he is a master at showcasing emotions. The way he designed, adapted, and executed the period drama is stunning. The box office numbers in Telugu will speak for itself and barring a slightly slow pace in the second half and dull episode of Ajay Devgan, RRR has everything to become a blockbuster at the box office and is a film that should be watched only on the big screen.",10/10,positive

2) Camera visuals
3) BGM
4) Work done on Climax part
5) Costume designer ( needs to be mentioned for the way they brought different types of comstumes on to the screen )
Cons :-
1) BGM ( at few places BGM went unsyncrosnised )
2) Didn't built characters upto there full potentials
3)Handling of story ( Definetly story had a great potential in it yet some how this time I think the calculations of Rajmouli didn't went to cent percent in delivering output )Over all :-More then a decent flick which make u feel good when u completed watching .",9/10,positive

This movie shows how we should live up to and celebrate greatest relationship of our life that is friendship.

Thank you to the team of RRR for making this movie and taking Indian cinema higher in all over the world stage.",10/10,positive
theredsky,Chaotic but in a good way is the best way to describe this movie. It's mostly nonstop energy for the entire 3 hour runtime and that's the best thing about this movie. The energy of this film is what makes this a must see from 2022 in my eyes. The performances and characters from N. T. Rama Rao Jr. And Ram Charan are great. They both have some great chemistry together and do a great job at developing their characters. S. S. Rajamouli's direction is really fun and so much better than his directing on Bahubali. The action is some of the most insane I've seen put to film ever. It's something that's hard to describe and is better being seen by your own eyes. You won't be disappointed though. It also has probably my favorite dance scene ever put to film as well. I honestly can't think of anything that tops it. When the film isn't action oriented or doing something fun then it can really drag. There's a 30-40 minute portion of the film that really drags on and on. Some of the performances here aren't exactly amazing also like from Alison Doody. If you want a really fun action and character oriented movie to watch with friends or on your own then I would highly recommend checking this out.,8/10,positive

SivSaagar,"Rajamouli is a Master in Narrating a normal storyline with engaging screenplay, impacting emotions, heroism elevations and stunning action sequences. In RRR too, he does the same by narrating it with slightly different style which works out majestically. Referencing Water and Fire to Bheem and Ram, showing their emotional side and aggressive side is very impressive. Even the Ramayana reference towards the end worked out well. SSR does an absolutely brilliant job again with RRR. On a Whole, RRR ends up as an Intense, Emotional and Highly Engaging Drama that gives an Epic Masterpiece Experience.

surajgorti,"RRR is a 2022 pan Indian film directed by SS Rajamouli , penned by the father of this legend 'vijayendra Prasad'. Starring Jr NTR, Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn ,Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris and others. As the title suggests RRR- Rise Roar Revolt, each and every elements are present with its after affects. When greater the cast, higher the responsibilities and SSR gave importance to each and every characters. Even the cameos were very well designed and were perfectly suited to the actors. When it comes to a multistarrer, several films failed to impress the audience. Whereas RRR has successfully achieved in registering this in audience's mind. The movie is worth waiting for 4 years. And Can say that the hype is real.Coming to the storySet in the late 20s , the duo Komaram Bheem (NTR) , Rama Raju (Ram Charan) are on their own paths. The way they meet each other ,which later created a bond of friendship between them were well shot . What guided to the confrontations / clashes between them is the sequence which I won't tell as it'll become a spoiler. And what made them together to fight against the blood seeker ,British empire is the plot . This movie completely depends on the 'whip the thew ' theory. Director SS Rajamouli brilliantly portrayed The duo's characters. Ram Charan as fire and NTR as water. SSR showcased them in a way we wanted to/ we expected to . They just nailed their roles. The cameos too have a great, significant role .AnalysisRRR is a film with the content that hits hard and deep, with well conducted scenes and rocking as well as emotional bgms that will make you feel emotional and raise your anger .Brilliant acting by the actors
Excellent direction BY SSR
Production values are at its best
Top notch cinematography by Senthil
Kumar
Stunning vis-a-vis related songs by MM

Amazing VFX
The fight scenes are very well shot. It'll
make you glued tobthe screens
hard hitting dialogues esp ' Thokkukuntu
povale' ( should surge forward)
'kumbhastalani baddalakodadam' (let's hunt
down the lion) such will definitely motivate
you .The interval bang is the biggest highlight.Alluri Seeta RamaRaju character portrayed
by charan with that ramam raghavam song
is the boon
Climax contains deep meaning , and can be fulfilled by few people
Emotional ride with awestruck execution.Positives
As described above
Naatu Naatu songNegatives
Predictable screenplay
Over dramatic scenes
Even after whipping the thew , he remains
still , which is the trademark of SSR.More importance to character 'Bheem' in
the ramam raghavam song which was
actually designed for Ram Charan.That's it..... Nothing else to find in this section.Verdict
Types of Theatres doesn't matter when the content is lit. You'll definitely shout during the scenes to express your excitement towards it. No matter what .This is truly a Goosebumps factory, some elements will definitely make you emotional, be it, anger / sorrow, which will throttle your aggression .Literally speaking , in this 3 hrs 6 mins duration, not even a single minute you'll feel bored (My pov). It is an excavation of elevations. Dig it,you'll find an awestruck visuals with elevations and it repeats . Saying it again , the king of storyteller , who has never seen the face of failure and will never, yet delivered another masterpiece . Shouldn't be compared with Bahubali series watch it as RRR you'll enjoy it for sure. #Must Watch.",8/10,positive

msn-wilson,"This homoerotic action thriller throws all caution to the wind. Who needs plot, character development or even basic rational thinking anyway?I found RRR hysterically funny. Of course this wasn't the film makers intention? Was it? I'm still confused about what I saw and who this film was supposed to be targeted to....at first I thought 10 year old boys, then 20 year old boys....ladies might be into this?The overdubbing and subtitling alone is worth the watch. Throw in some shirtless Indian men battling tigers, hordes of other Indian men and leaping about on each others shoulders and you've got a piece of cinematic gold. The two heroes skipping along beside a train was a just magical. Why you may ask were they doing this? Well, why not I say!",10/10,positive

sharaddayma,Kudos SS Rajamouli👏🏻You have yet again created a masterpiece 🤘 your big budgets are truly justified by the magnanimity of your presentation👏🏻 It was a real treat to watch your presentation of India's freedom movement from Hindu values and texts in this larger than life epic👍 with real heros be it our gods or our true freedom fighters...Your representation of Muslim elements did not seem like a narrative compulsion but really seemed that Hindus and Muslims fought shoulder to shoulder. I am really proud of you that you are not buckling down to appeasement pressures unlike the rest of the shameless Bollywood. I feel proud of being an Indian and being a Hindu and being truly secular and tolerant🙏 Again thanks for this creative genius and an amazing gift to the cinema world. You make Marvel and DC Comics look so uncreative and insignificant.,10/10,positive

vasudevaa,"This movie directed by SS Rajamouli is a blockbuster. It is an absolute treat to watch.Plus Points:
There are an unlimited amount of highs in this movie. The highs are on a different level and comparable to Hollywood level and marvel level movies.Emotionally we get connected a lot in these highs too. For me the interval scene and the komaram bheemuda song scene were the most hard hitting.SS Rajamouli also shows his genius writing in this movie. He didn't leave cliché moments just to move the story. There is one scene where Rahul Ramakrishna uses a snake to try to kill ram charan by making a sound with a twig, and it clearly shows rajamouli's creativity in the screenplay.Minus Points:
There are some parts in the second half where it is slightly dull. For me personally, the flashback portion was kind of dull and felt elongated. It could've been delivered better but other than that everything else felt seamless in the story and screenplay.Overall:
This is an out and out Rajamouli Action Movie! For action lovers this will be rated as a blockbuster but for people that only come for the story and overall feel could rate it as a hit!Did Rajamouli manage to balance both the heros, Ntr and Ram Charan?Although, it revolves around both of them mostly equally, if you would have to classify one of them as the main character then it would be ram charan because of his character arc. Ram charan has an internal conflict and a turning point in the movie whereas Ntr's character is more plain and goes by the same level throughout the film. Due to this we feel as if ram charan's character is more complete and as if we know more about him.Me, being an ntr fan I was slightly disappointed to see this. I wanted to see more variation, more character, and a more dominant personality for him. I cannot blame this on Rajamouli. He did his absolute best to do justice to the script but I still wish there was a little more to ntr.Is this better than SS Rajamouli's previous movie bahubali the conclusion? Well, this is a very opinionated question. If you are an action lover and crave for intense and powerful scenes then you would like RRR more. If you watch movies for their stories and the overall feel of it then you would like bahubali 2 more.Personally, I liked Bahubali better. I felt like I connected with the characters more and that the story line was more complete.So Should You Watch it in the Theater?Unless you are an action hater, this is definitely a movie you MUST WATCH in the THATER!",8/10,positive

zanghi_james,"I really enjoyed S. S. Rajamouli's two-part film Baahubali. When I heard he had made a supposedly-even bigger and better film about the early days of India's revolt against the British occupation, I was intrigued.I watched R. R. R. Recently over the course of a weekend on Netflix and really enjoyed it. I sort of imagined it to be like Once Upon A Time in China, since the film's story is about fictional depictions of two historical people in India's history, and true, it has great martial arts and has a good message about how the British Empire caused a lot of trouble for various countries, and fortunately, the similarities end right about there.The film is one of those films where it has a seemingly simplistic plot that rapidly becomes complex, but fortunately to not the Nolan or Fincher extreme level. Much like Baahubali, this is a musical and there is an odd balance between some of the most spectacular dance and song numbers and strong levels of violence. The movie does also have some grim moments, mainly the scene where Bheem is flogged savagely in public, and there are a lot of bone-crunching noises in some of the fight scenes that may deter people. The fight scenes are quite satisfying throughout, though.The acting is enjoyable in this film, though I thought Ahktar/Bheem had a slightly child-like personality. The twist with Ram/Raju is an excellent twist, and you can see so much pain and conflict in his character afterwards, because at first you think he's just an ambitious cop but he actually has ulterior motives. The villains are truly despicable characters, but mostly one-dimensional in comparison to the rest of the cast. I did like the casting of Alison Doody as the Governor's cruel wife, and she does a great villain again, but like I said, it seems like the script could have expanded on their characters a little more. Olivia Morris shines as the lovable Jenny Scott, a niece of the Governor, also, and I would have enjoyed some more story with her, as well, especially with her romance with Bheem. Hopefully, the sequel will expand on that aspect with Bheem and Jenny.The action scenes are, as I previously said, are fantastic, though a little chaotic. The musical numbers and the score are outstanding, also, and several of the numbers truly reached into my soul and awakened something in me, most notably the 'Dosti' sequence.There are some flaws to this film, but even so, RRR is a great production and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in Indian cinema.May the Force be with You!",9/10,positive
swethalagisetti,"While I was watching the movie, it was all roars from the beginning to the end. I did not have such an experience in the recent past for any film. People were shouting and clapping all through the movie. When the movie ended, it's sooo interesting that I felt I would re-watch it again.RRR is a personification of magnificence and valor. Rajamouli did a perfect justice by tightly packing all the elements of a good cinema. Both the heroes, Jr. NTR and Ramcharan, are at their best in performance. As usual, Alia Bhatt is gorgeous and spectacle. Few songs are folk but will surely make you tap your feet.

I take it back what I said about Andhaadun being the best indian film I've seen after RRR because RRR it's magical. If you like more 19th century and ludicrous action this is a must watch. It is a little to long being a 3h film but you can easily watch in 2 clear separated parts.",9/10,positive

Roman-pc,"RRR is among the most if not the most wildly fun movie experience you will have this year--see it or miss out. It's a must-see if you are a fan of movies in general let alone of action movies.Neither the logline nor the plot overview do any kind of justice to the almost bonkers ""Spinal Tap""-esque level 11 this movie hits on pretty much every filmmaking parameter out there. Granted Telugu is my mother tongue so call me biased--but I lived in the US for almost 20 years including a stint in California making indie films. All of which to say I am a film guy and this is an exceptional piece of filmmaking, regardless of where you're from.Now for the plot details that get things going: During the British Raj in India, a young Gond tribal girl named Malli is taken by the local Brit powers-that-be and hence a Gond tribal warrior named Bhim vows to get her back. In order to do so, he goes incognito in Delhi sheltered by a local Muslim family. Simultaneously, for reasons that will become clear later, an up-and-coming native in the British Indian army (Raju) is out to impress his British superiors by almost single-handedly booking a rioter amidst a veritable mob in a breathtaking action sequence. (That sequence is one of several throughout the movie that simply ups the ante on your received sense of how much stuff a film scene could carry.) Turns out both these men are fighting the British in their own way--and the movie is about how their paths ultimately converge.Tell you what, give it 30 min and most likely you wouldn't be able to stop even if you wanted to. I watched it twice--both in the original Telugu and in the dubbed Hindi language version. But language doesn't matter. When it's good it's good.",10/10,positive

The action scenes are not all accurate but it is a Mass entertainer so it is justifiable. Ram charan and Jr. NTR both have given their best but I feel Alia Bhatt and Ajay Devgan's characters were just outplaced. The CGI was very good in some places but looked weak in some places like in case of animals. But this can be totally ignored as the story is too good to you even noticing those small details.The bgm of the movie is my favourite.This movie lengths nearly 3hour but you didn't even for a single moment feel bored the cinematography and screenplay is just so engaging.And the best you can enjoy this Mass entertainer with your family without any worries.🔥

landourhomelala,"The last time director SS Rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film Baahubali: The Conclusion. It took him 5 long years for him to conceptualise his next film RRR, shoot and bring it to the silver screen. Pulling off a multi-starrer with Jr NTR and Ram Charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself. But Rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the story.RRR is set in the 1920s and revolves around the lives of two revolutionaries - Alluri Seetharama Raju who waged an armed campaign against the British and Komaram Bheem a tribal from the Gond tribe who fought against atrocities heaped on his people. There is no historical evidence to show that the two ever met or fought together but Rajamouli reimagines history and weaves a story around their meeting.RRR runs on a relatively simple premise. There's 'fire' - an angry, young police officer Ramaraju (Ram Charan) who is both revered and feared by the British. He has done their every bidding for years, he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet, he is the one who's never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin. Then there's 'water' - sweet, simple, innocent Bheem (Jr NTR) who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose. He's a Gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called Malli, who was taken away by Lady Scott (Alison Doody), to be the singing doll 'on (her) mantelpiece'. But that is just the beginning of the tale.",10/10,positive
vidyuthvinodh,"RRR has an amazing story and great casting. If you like good visuals, this is the movie for you. Some people may say that they didn't like the move because of all the blood and violence, but in my opinion that's probably what makes RRR stand out. The director has done an amazing job and I am eagerly waiting for whatever he comes up with next. If this review was helpful and you want to watch it, watch it with friends, because, A.it is a good movie to watch so why not let other people enjoy. B. The whole theme about the movie is friendship.

harshsam,"Again a masterstroke by SS Rajamouli. It's an absolute masterpiece in terms of storytelling, music, action, and climax; what more can one expect from movies?The movie never disengages, it will keep you absorbed the whole time. The way elements of Fire & Water are represented and portrayed as co-actors nature is amazing.The cinematography is a treat to the eyes.The music scores serve their purpose and fit perfectly with every scene. You cannot complain of excess of anything. Everything is so measured and so beautiful.However, It is 3hour long so can be tiring for some but not for me as epic storytelling requires time and you as an audience would have been complaining if it was cut short.I only gave it a 9 because some creative action scenes are way unrealistic but I am not complaining. The whole movie is so good that it can be forgiven but after giving us many blockbusters like Eega, Bahubali series, it is expected from the director to up his action scenes game.And CGI in some of the scenes is a bit janky but that is only due to financial constraints.Hey, I liked it and I know you will too, it hasn't got universal acclaim for no reason. Don't believe me? Google for yourself. So what are you waiting for? Go watch it now.",9/10,positive

Hero knows how to ride a motor bike at a time when bikes where a luxury and that too an Indian riding it without any previous contact of how to ride one. Bicycles too were uncommon at that time.

I loved the way this movie was written and was presented to the audience. Music was also fine. Both the actors(Ram Charan & N. T. R Jr.) make sure that the audience are held tight onto their seats with their great acting.Pros:-
*Plot of movie was brilliant
*Great Writing
*Excellent storytelling
*Direction
*Acting(including cameos)
*Cinematography
*Action
*Score and songs were also fineCons:-
*VFX ( Yeah, I know some people may disagree but I felt that there was a bit lack in VFX which prevented it from realistic look. But under a budget of 150 Cr. It was appreciable, it was also the time of COVID so it's understandable)
*Defies Physics (See I know it's the case in most of the movies, I thought of not even considering it but one or two scenes just made me think 'How's this even possible?'
*Quick Health recovery (When Ram gets bit by snake Bheem uses 'jadibuti' for his quick recovery also when he was injured severely by British but one scene which completely made no sense to me was when Bheem was brutalised in public, it was shown to us in such a brutal manner that it seemed he could barely stand but it's seen that the very next day when he was to be prosecuted he gets completely recover and is able to fight the British with complete ease, this didn't make even a bit of sense to me.)That's it folks. If the VFX would have been a bit better I would have easily given it a rating of 9 or 9½.",8/10,negative

Rjamauli mix all the emotions perfectly in a very excellent proportion .It looks like it is a serious,action,revenge movie but it has a romantic,comedy,etc kinds or so many genres .The VFX quality is also so important for this kind of big movie and they uses a excellent VFX for this. Especially the tiger scene when NTR entry comes in . The way the manner they show water stillness and fire's anger in the movie is osm. Really it is a huge budget movie the team used to choose the best quality cameras and in my sence it was an outstanding dicision by makers, it makes the movie like out of this world .And in about acting everyone's acting is superb specially NTR, he is my favorite too so 😁and Ram Charan is a class actor we all know that and his body wow.. man literally gives the goosebumps experience and it is a telugu movie so it thought alia will not comfortably adjust but she did really well unless I really didn't like so much her acting but it was good.And too many alia related scenes were deleted from this movie make me feel good because i want that jay veeru friendship bond back in this movie in the form of aktar and raju and this movie doesn't make me feel regret .WOW..",10/10,positive
luoji-64737,"I thought going into this movie I will enjoy some classic Bollywood movie. How I was wrong. I am used to exaggerated storylines and over the top acting, but this was too much, even for me. The characters were extremely 2 dimensional for you to even care about them. This overexaggerated plotline only works if the characters are well written and if it can bring you some sympathy towards them. Neither the villain nor the protagonist were likeable. The Bromance came out of nowhere and not convincing. The CGI were terrible and the acting too cheesy, I felt the cheesiness oozing from the screen, and that's not a compliment, I cringed really hard that I had to bail out on the movie halfway.",1/10,positive

gajwelsreekanth,"While the Bheem-Malli thread is Rhapsodic, Rama Raju is Resilient in his underplayed character and with the master story-teller #Rajamouli at the helm, the final output is Riveting...#NTR gets into the skin of his character as usual.. while he is innocent in his camaraderie with Ram Charan and his scenes with Olivia Morris in the first half, he's ferocious in his introduction scene as well as his confrontation scenes with Ram Charan in the later parts...#RamCharan gets an opportunity to showcase variations in his role and the way he holds all the intense emotions in his eyes until he unleashes himself in the captivating climax is spell binding.. it's not an easy task to match the magnanimity of NTR on screen and Rajamouli manages to balance both lead actors.. after all, he has played a key role in their successful careers and he extracts their best yet again..I wasn't quite impressed with the audio songs earlier but their presentation on screen was stupendous... as it is always the case with Rajamouli's films, the seasoned musician #Keeravani's BGM is the soul of #RRR...Komaram Bheemudo song is a testimony of NTR's acting prowess and it's among the best episodes of the movie apart from the first 15 min, the interval block and the climax portion...Cinematography by Senthil, Production design by Sibu Cyril, action choreography by Solomon - all technicians deserve an applause for their outstanding work..Every time one thinks #Rajamouli has already delivered his best, he continues to better his unparalleled work... being an epitome of perfection in the world of cinema, he delivers a winner at the box-office yet again...#RRR is the pride of India cinema and the Telugu audience must celebrate it instead of debating as to which of the two lead actors got larger screen space, whose role was better and so on...It's a must watch for all movie lovers cutting across the linguistic borders and genres... my rating is 4.5/5.",9/10,positive
chanikya1,"One Of The Greatest Movie Of All Time!!!. An Instant Classic!!!!. RRR movie sets new phenomenal benchmark for Indian Cinema. It has opened the magical door of international market & of course it stood Giant sequoia of Indian Film Industry.This movie is a fantasy drama, all about the friendship between the two historical freedom fighters of same period, who never met each other in real life.1. Alluri Sitarama Raju was the tribal peasant's leader in the Gudem Hills of Andhra Pradesh. Telugu revolutionary who waged an armed campaign against British colonial rule in India.2. Komaram Bheem, was a revolutionary leader in Telangana from the Gond tribes,known for fighting against the local rule of Nizam.The movie starts with. In 1920, British governor Scott and his wife visit Adilabad forest, and forcefully take away a talented girl from the Gond tribe. In the process of rescue the girl, the tribe's protector Komaram Bheem becomes the most wanted in the British government. The government appoints a powerfull police officer Alluri Sita Rama Raju to capture the Bheem.RRR is high technology. Imaginative director. The tasteful cocktail of Emotions with Frindship, Patriotism, History, Culture and basic Human values.NTR acting as innocent, Ram Charan's roller coaster performance and rajamouli magic made RRR as a Gem.",10/10,positive
vedantsharmaand,"Ss rajauamli is one the finest directors in INDIAN film industry. This film is justifying its budget and is really a grand movie. Great music, action, sets, dialogs.Basically a story of 2 Indian tribal heroes who in reality never met but the filmmakers has given an approach to make the meet in their movie. You might find the action to be very unrealistic as it stereotyped about South Indian language films but in this case, it is justified as Alluri Sitharam Raju and bheema are really considered as hero in their tribal folk tales and stories about them doing things which are not achievable by average human are comman.The plot is amazing, the sets are grand. And it also represents the nation in a justified manner. So you should surely watch the film, or else you'll miss a lot of things.",10/10,positive

ACTION SEQUENCES:- Is it really required to elucidate?? Even Americans appreciated these scenes.. What a unique one!!4. ACTING:- Especially NTR and RC did the best in their career.. NTR poured out his experiences, what a dedication..Komaram bheemudo scene proved that.. RC switched from betrayal to dostii to a real patriotic hero was beyond my words..

1. Big Stars like Ramcharan, NTR Jr. & Alia (Alia to some extent only) who delivered solid performances.2. Great story-telling & relevance to pre-independence era.3. Ray Stevenson and Olivia Morris are fabulous in their parts and play a major role in the story.Negatives: Only negatives are:

But is still has a great story to tie it all together.Even though I had only heard great things about this movie, nothing could have prepared me for this.Three hours of epic action and hilarious over-the-top stunts.

This film is 3 hr long but with the amount of storytelling, performance and entertainment value, the time went by quickly. The film benefits alot from its lead actors. Ram Charan and NTR Jr have a nice on-screen chemistry and carry the movie on their shoulders. I liked both the characters they played as they are a mirror image of one another and ultimately want the same thing but their circumstances pit them against each other. The story while it isn't novel, it is presented well and in the way that is easy-to-follow.

Gabmoreno2,"This is the first official Bollywood film review I will write about; for context, I've seen Slumdog Millionaire and Life of Pi before, but that was when I was younger. I only knew about this film's reception being exceptionally well received in the critical space, winning Best Oscar for Best Foreign Film in the 2023 Oscars ceremony.RRR, as a Historical Epic, is a film that delves deep into the cultural significance of India's revolutions around the late 1800s and the brutality of the British Empire's colonialism. It's a journey that will enlighten you about India's rich history.The film delves into two main characters, Rama (played by Ram Charan), a dedicated police officer serving the British Empire, and Bheem (played by N. T. Rama Rao Jr.), a village protector on a mission to rescue his sister from the clutches of the British. Their individual journeys and the eventual convergence of their paths form the heart of the film.Rama, much like the iconic superhero Batman, is a relentless force for justice, working within the system to achieve his goals.Bheem is a Village protector seeking his sister, who has been taken by the British Empire and will only stop once the mission is complete. He's Inda Superman.They make up the film's idea-or core, if you will-of brotherly Friendship, that being Fire and Water.The film's cinematography is quite impressive, combining an artistic aesthetic of an outstanding number of crowds to add to the environment with visuals of 1800s India's culture in clothing, music, and set design. This is greatly enhanced when the action scenes commence when the film's aesthetic adds a visual flair of vitality to these fight scenes (including the dance battle ).The acting is excellent, especially when it's the drama scenes; however, due to the film's fun flair with the action scenes, the dramatic scenes are engaging but lose a bit of the seriousness in the movie; that is not to say all of the dramatic scenes have this issue, but it does happen two times in the film, one near the very end where Ray Stevenson character Scott Buxton & his wife Catherine Buxton played by Alison Doody watch Bheem's torture scene. In contrast, the scene is agitated. It loses a bit of that intensity due to the film's anime influences, which show both main characters ' abilities to stay strong, but that's a minor nitpick I had with the film.The music in RRR is a unique blend of traditional Indian songs and modern music. It adds weight to the action scenes and moments of suspenseful drama, immersing you deeper into the film's narrative.The film has two dances, one of which is a dance battle with the song ""Naatu Naatu,"" performed at the Oscars ceremony. The film also ends with another dance moment that tells us about the history of India's freedom fighters.The film's tone is quite severe during the dramatic moments that the camera stays on the scenes, in which watching this Brotherly Bond between the two main characters becomes in a way like a Telenovela as well a comedy due to the impressive yet fantastic anime-inspired extravaganza, with will keep most people entertained and engaged with the story's tone and unraveling of the characters motivations and history.The chemistry between the characters is very profound, having their Bond evolve from found friendship to wingmen to enemies to finally Brothers, which is very noticeable in the later half of the film where their perseverance in fighting against the British adds a significant effect to their complete understanding of one another, it is pretty similar to the series Naruto where Naruto and Sasuke without uttering a single word in complete combat understand each other's life. This is similar to Bheem and Rama slowly uncovering each other's past and how the English have affected their lives and country by having action scenes where they complement each other, ideally like Water and Fire.Overall, I had a blast with this film, and I will give RRR a 10/10 for balancing Mature and historical themes and light-hearted moments with impressive camera movements and deep storytelling in this three-hour film.",10/10,positive

Akshay_Perumalla,"For all the international audiences who are showing an immense love for this movie. Here is the subtext used from Hindu Epics Ramayana and Mahabharat in RRR.Character Ram: By the name, we see how Ram's character has the reflection in Lord Rama. He was away from his homeland for many years like Rama, who has a fiance named Sita. A girl who has been in the center point like in Ramayana and the British Palace is signified as Lanka. And the parting away of Rama and Sita and the long waiting for Sita beautifully blended into the storyline. Apart from that, we can literally see Ramcharan wearing a Kesari Dhoti and firing arrows like Lord Rama. The picturization of that scene is whistling-worthy.Character Bheem: On the other hand, Bheem is signified as one of the Pandavas (5 Brothers in Mahabharat), Bheema. He has immense strength and can fight with a tiger and lift a motorbike with his hand. He also acted as a messenger between Ram and Sita just like Hanuman but again if you remember both Bheema and Hanuman are sons of Vayu (The God of Wind).",10/10,positive

However although second half was definitely NOT bad, but wasn't as good as the first half. Cinematography, visual effects and CGI(although not best) were great and larger than life. The music and songs were also emotionally pumping, fun and engaging to listen to. Ram and Bheem bromance along with the friendship and drama was good. Also the theme of rising against oppression and fire, water were also symbolic and really resonating to experience.Interval block was a bang on screen.Disappointments:

paulclaassen,"Rise. Roar. Revolt. Wow, 'RRR' is an incredible action-packed adventure comedy drama. Based on actual people, the story is all fiction, though. Interesting...Governor Scott Buxton (Ray Stevenson) and his wife Catherine (Alison Doody) abducts a young girl, Malli, from a peaceful tribe because Catherine insists on ""having her"" for her artistic talent, taking her with to their lavish residence. The British are selfish, rude and racists who believe they can do as they please.A tribesman, Bheem (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.), disguises himself as Muslim Akhtar as he goes in search of Malli to rescue her. When Catherine hears of a ""hunter"" who will come for Malli, she offers a promotion to the man who captures this hunter. The ambitious officer Rama Raju (Ram Charan) vows to capture him.During a a train accident, Bheem and Raju teams up in a daring rescue operation to save a young boy, and thereafter they become friends. Raju doesn't realize Bheem is the man he is meant to capture. The men become close and seeing these two muscled hunks dancing and doing things together as if they were a gay couple, was an absolute treat. It was kind of a beautiful romance, actually (although it wasn't a romance). When Bheem meets Jenny (Olivia Morris) and becomes smitten with her, Raju helps them get better acquainted. As luck would have it, she works at the Buxton residence, and might just be Bheem's ticket to saving Malli.'RRR' is an epic action movie unlike any other. You are guaranteed to see action choreography like you've never seen before. Ok, it's not always plausible, but it was fun (and some sequences were unintentionally funny). Many of these action sequences are for effect and sensation only. But it was SO ENTERTAINING!!! The film is stunningly photographed, with fantastic cinematography and amazing slow motion photography. 'RRR' is a visual spectacle in every sense of the word. But apart from the stunning visuals and action, it has a really good story. I cared about these characters.The film doesn't tell us much about Bheem's background, but Raju's back story is told in detail. By the time the film reaches the third act, we realize Raju has been working towards fulfilling a dream an honouring a promise he made to his Dad. Some of his actions are going to make you wonder why he is doing it, but it all makes sense towards the end. This character is very well set up, and his determination is to be admired. He also has a beautiful romantic back story in the form of his fiancée, Sita (Alia Bhatt)The well-written song lyrics cleverly aided the narration. For a 3 hour movie, there never was a single dull moment. This film grips you from the opening and never lets go until that incredible finale! This is definitely one of 2022's best movies. I loved every minute of 'RRR'!",8/10,positive

anamalli,"A spellbinding blockbuster, which has taken us back to the 1920s. Both Junior NTR & Ram Charan have performed well. The movie will be remembered by the future generations for viewing along with the Freedom movement collection.One ""Faux pas"" (HOWLER) is the truck which enters the fort with loads of animals, carries the latest logo of ""TATA MOTORS"" on the rear wheel hub. Although the movie belongs to the 1920s. Tata motors had started production of trucks as late as year 1954 after Indian Independence. This is the failure of the research team.All said & done the movie is great to watch, but ranks way down below Bahubali 1 & 2.",9/10,positive
masonfisk,"A Bollywood actioner from 2022 streaming on Netflix. During the British rule of India, a contingent of rebel factions are starting to threaten that rule w/a jungle leader, played by N. T. Rama Rao Jr, emerging as the head guy in charge (I wonder why, was it the scene where he corrals a tiger?). Things come to a head when his sister is taken away by the ruling magistrate, Ray Stevenson, since she was quite prodigious in applying henna tattoos on his wife's (played by Alison Doody from Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade) hands. Enter Ram Charan, an ambitious member of the British forces who is guaranteed a leadership position if he catches Rao Jr. Which becomes a bit of a thriller since when he does meet him, as they both save a child from falling debris from a bridge, they bond but they don't know they're actually on opposite sides of the impending violence so when it comes, we get Charan's backstory & his true motives, setting up the extended conflict which wraps up the narrative. Now a warning, if you've never indulged in a Bollywood film then the sheer gamut of emotions that you'll go through will snap the neck of most casual viewers but if you're up for it then you'll get the closest thing to a visual smorgasbord as this film has action, adventure, horror & a song number or two w/the all the players gleefully serving up this mishmash w/a smile on their collective faces or gallons of tears wiped from anguished cheeks.",8/10,negative

* For Ram, the story and Purpose is strong.* For Bhim, the story is good and the purpose to fight could be improved.Action Scenes: Awesome.Logic : Missing* if ram has a hidden purpose, then why can't he acquire strength for his movement by making alliance with bhim?* why should he torture rahul?* If there is a blast at railway track, where trains are new to the people, why rahul didnt look back and have a glance which might reveal ram, is he deaf?* How can ram stand and fight with the wonded knees where bhim carried ram since he is not able to move in the previous scene.Sentiment: Felt good, people cried in some scenes.Expectation: A movie which is more awesome than Baahubali or KGF but not in this case.Eventhough both characters have equal importance, ram got highlighted because of his past story and strength in it.Evenif Story is weak, logics are missing, the movie is good and action entertainer.",9/10,positive

raghavrastogi-97751,"After the pan-India blockbuster Baahubali-1&2, Rajamouli sir is back with a bang with another appealing story set amidst the freedom struggle. The main characters, played well by Jr. NTR & Ram Charan, have been inspired from lives of two real heroes from Telangana & Andhra - Komaram Bheem & Sitarama Raju.While I watched the movie in Hindi, but having stayed in the south for so long, I can imagine the reactions this movie in Telugu/Tamil would have generated in the theatres. These kind of films are made to be watched & enjoyed in Cinemas with friends & family. The visuals, background score (Keeravani sir again) and cinematography were excellent. The over-the-top action sequences, again like Baahubali, are the highlights of the movie.However, at around 3hrs, it was a bit of stretch (unlike the 2 Baahubali movies), and I did catch myself looking elsewhere in the theatre & at my phone at times. I guess it is because Rajamouli is a story teller and often incorporates a lot of ideas from history & mythology.Nonetheless, an Indian movie worth watching on big screens is a huge respite to those who have been film-starved these past 2 years, with good action & direction.",8/10,positive
jaysanchu07,"Talk about overhyped. RRR was indeed an experience but unfortunately, an excruciating one at that. With a runtime of a whopping 187 minutes, it was quite a chore to get through this film, only to leave a bad taste from it's atrocious almost everything.RRR's misfortunes starts with its immature screenplay & direction. Sure its storyline drew interest despite it being highly predictable (wife guessed its turnout 30 minutes in), but how it unravels was head scratching. The repetitive episodes of ""hero saves the distressed"" was exhausting, given each exploit posed lousy challenges. The facade that is the friendship/bromance of its leads comes off as a sham, crammed in for the sake of storyline convenience. The overuse of slow motion capture in EVERY LITTLE THING was laughable. Apart from these, RRR demeans its audience as well, as it pushes for expositions for EVERY significant plot twist. Sadly, the list goes on with glaring plot holes left and right and generic villains. If only focus was shifted from that added flair to storytelling, perhaps RRR could've been compelling.On the acting piece, credit to its leads as the energy from the top notch action & dance resonates. When serious acting is demanded however, RRR falls a mile short, as not one face on screen had a convincing performance. Overacting was the name of the game, & the annoyance from the insane melodrama renders connecting to its characters as a challenge.Perhaps my ignorance on Indian films & the culture around it is reason for my criticisms against RRR. I refuse however, to comply with rules or structures on how I enjoy my film. If everything is an exaggeration without sensible compromise, difficult to take any film seriously.",4/10,negative
srsnkarthikeya,"Finally, the most awaited movie was released today. I watched RRR (Rise, Roar, Revolt)movie made with a budget of 500 crores.It's a visual treat. S S Rajamoulis another gem of a movie after Bahubali.It is a fictional story about two Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (jnr NTR ), who fought against the British RajFull action-packed movie. Action sequences are the best directed by renowned Hollywood action director Nick Powell..
Cinematography by K senthil kumar was mind-blowing. BGM by M M keeravani was good .Overall, it was a very good movie . Ram Charan steals the show; his acting was brilliant, screen presence fight scenes, and all was top notch.Jnr NTR also supported well, and both have got equal importance in the movie.Alia Bhatt, Ajay Devgan , and samuthirakani all supported well and gave full justice to their characters played.Even the English actors were brilliant.Making of the movie is so good like camera work, fight with animals, lights and all .Technically a brilliant movie.Some scenes are so mind-blowing .I kept thinking how did the director shot that and how he thought about such scenes.This shows the brilliance of the director and his vision.1st half is mind-blowing. You will love it
2nd half is stretched, slow, but you will never be bored.It's a 3 hour long movie.Enjoy this movie in Theater only because it's a visual treat .The animal fight scenes are superb .If you get a chance to watch it in 3D you will enjoy it more for sure.After a long time, a big magnumplus blockbuster movie has come.Watch it, and it's not to be missed.I'm hoping this movie breaks all the records.Don't miss the Sholay song at the end when they show the credits..

Some of the scenes are really good and you will feel the thrill for the same by watching this movie. Those scenes will be stay in your mind. Animation used for action is really good. Only VFX used for animals should be more refined. Also, this is a south Indian movie so need to neglect some excessive action scenes. They should have easily given lead heroine role to someone else. There is no need of Alia Bhatt for this role as she has very less acting scope in this movie. Acting done by both lead heroes is phenomenal including their dance steps. Overall, this is a must watch file. Do watch with 5.1 surround sound using home theater to get best experience.",10/10,positive

Firstly he removed the great historical fight of Konaram Bheem against Nizam, didn't even mention Nizam, instead made British the sole villain. While The British were nowhere close in cruelty of Islamic oppressors. Then Rajamaulvi showed extra-patriotism of Beard-Skullcap in the 1st 10 m. Of the movie.

hoernkeem,"'RRR' is an historical action epic from Indian director S. S. Rajamouli who wrote the screenplay as well. This guy is kind of like James Cameron and Peter Jackson rolled into one. He is pretty much at the peak of Telugu language Indian films. 'RRR' is the most expensive Indian film to date. It stars N. T. Rama Rao Jr. And Ram Charan as real life Indian revolutionaries Khomaram Bheem and Alluri Sitarama Raju. The film was oft delayed in both production and release due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but finally hit theaters in March of 2022, and was met with both positive reviews and financial success.It is 1920 in British India and they are truly the evil empire exemplified by a fairly casual abduction of a young girl from a small village by a harsh administrator and his equally depraved wife. The tribe's guardian Bheem chases after in an effort to find and rescue the girl. Meanwhile we meet Raju who ,while native, is an ambitious officer in the British army. After an impressive display against a mob he is enlisted to help ferret out this protector who has come to the city for the girl when they get wind that a champion has been dispatched to retrieve her. Randomly Bheem and Raju meet saving a boy and become best friends which sets up a clearly interesting dynamic as Bheem conducts his hunt for the girl Malli in secret and equally in secret Raju is looking for Bheem although he is unaware that is who he hunts. There are more twists and turns in the this three hour epic culminating in an intense and satisfying climax.While I don't shy away from any international cinema I have really never delved Indian/Bollywood/Tollywood cinema in any form or fashion. 'RRR' is more than accessible from a story standpoint, as well as being easy to find and watch as it is on Netflix. This landed on my radar after I saw a USA Today article in June of 2022 that called 'RRR' the best film of the year so far. It is certainly something else. It does have some of the song and dance elements although it is not so much that you would really even consider it a musical. The action here is some highly stylized, over the top action hero insanity. None of what Bheem and Raju do or endure can be considered grounded in reality. They both become larger than life and it is very enjoyable to see their stories develop and then come crashing together. It is also interesting that both appear to be alpha male action stars so you know that while they start with an intense bromance they will have to have have some static being on very opposite sides at the outset of the film. The action here is intense and off the wall fun. The plot hooks you in and in makes the film not feel anything like its three hour run time. I am not sure I would label it the best of the year, but this is quite good, and is a solid entry film for anyone wanting branch out and sample some big budget action fare from other lands.Eric's Grade: B+",8/10,positive

oknikameu,"Grand scale production, highly curated screenplay, and adrenaline rush editing; possibly the best mass entertainer of the year. Director S. S. Rajamouli's signature slow-motion cut swiftly takes the audience on an adventurous journey for three hours with the movie promising to live up to the hype.Direction: Rajamouli is one of those Indian directors who presents simplistic elements of the story with a creative and intriguing scale of production. With RRR, the director also showcases what it is like to experience a fictional story based on real characters. It is to be noted that both leading characters, played by Ram Charan and N. T. Rama Rao Jr., never really crossed paths in Indian history. But the scale of imagination and fictional elements that are presented in RRR will definitely make the audience emotional; especially if you are familiar with Indian history.Screenplay: The film was delayed several times and took almost five years to successfully make it to the big screen. Curation of every scene with minute details and well-integrated continuity is something that will amaze you about RRR. Unlike Rajamouli's previous Bhahubali films, RRR minimises the use of over the top action scenes and instead focuses on the emotional elements of the characters. While the movie is three hours long, Rajamouli and the team managed successfully to make the audience enjoy every bit of the film.Cinematography: The amount of workflow that has gone into RRR's light settings, set design, and creation is unimaginable. As an avid still photographer, who has worked on a few regional films in the past, I can say that it is a lifetime opportunity for a cinematographer to work on such grand-scale projects. K. K. Senthil Kumar's cinematography does make RRR special with the use of a large-format ARRI Alexa LF camera and prime lenses. Every action scene, conversation, and character close-ups really make it feel real with Kumar's highly evolved cinematography. Kumar has been a long time associate of Rajamouli and has previously worked with him on several films including Chatrapati, Baahubali: The Beginning, and Baahubali: The Conclusion.",8/10,positive

yaswanth-29843,"Loved the movie. Though the story is not as strong as Bahubali but what really gave this movie life is the emotional bonding between the two protagonists that is sure to pull you inHIGHLIGHTS- The entry scenes. Rajamouli has created the top 2 entrances in Indian film industry in one movie
Ram charan's entry stands tall. The way he handled so many people and making it look realistic and how he shows us what ram charan truly is in scene
NTR's opening- that damn ripped body and ntr's expressions and the use of cgi by mouli sir is too good and also the setting
THE SETS- you can see the huge darn sets making them look authentic and aesthetic at the same time
THE SONGS- each song is a gem in its own reference portraying and elevating the scene to higher emotional bounds and the one which stands out is of course naatu naatu . The choreographer did the job of his life time. The coordination and the mass . Just too good
And my second favourite scene after ram charan's entry is the interval bang- DAMN VFX AND NTR's entry. THE HUGE SCALE FIGHTS OMG JUST A FEAST
Mediocre- though some character standout in the movie other than leads like ram's uncle, malli, Scott or Jenny the main cameos of Ajay Devgan and Aalia were weak and not so captivating
The story is not so great but is enough to keep us engaged
UNDERWHELMING ASPECTS-
The last 20 mins- though there were some great sequences like the lead's reunion ram charan's portrayal of Rama and the blast of the governed building which were very well executed, the Vfx and the prison break scenes made me cringe
The bridge scene though is a nice scene the under water running was a drag
Sometimes the Vfx made it look cartoonish
BUT STILL ACTION SCENES IN INDIA LIKE NEVER BEFORE, entertaining acting and dances

Which is not case with bollywood, they always manage to find ways to hurt sentiments and promoting Islamic agenda with every movie, web series or ads.You can't find a boring moment in over 3 hour length movie , even after finishing you crave for more, that's I'm sure fulfill by it's sequal. In acting Ram Charan & NT Rama rao gives their till date best performance. Ajay Devgan create deep impact on full movie with his short role. Alia has nothing substantial to do in movie, also looks misfit for serious roles. Ray Stevenson looks impressive as Scott. Mark Bennington always do justice for his role.Every frame is so big that it should be watch only on big screen. Actions of the film are over the top at par with Bahubali.I suggest it's a must watch with family.",9/10,positive
vickydhumale,"Honestly you can skip the negative reviews. Despite being the biggest hit The Kashmir Files, RRR successfully won my mind with its beautiful story and action. Felt like second Bahubali to me.For a moment I thought of Ramayana while watching the movie. Thanks a lot for the movie. Good part is its amazing visuals and 3D effects.Will watch again in IMAX 3D...Once again its Very awesome movie. Wonderful movie with splendid directions and acting of Jr NTR and Ram Charan was CLASS!!!",10/10,positive
bijupillai73-1,"RRR (Hindi Version)A SPECTACLE is something exhibited to view as unusual, notable, or entertaining
especially : an eye-catching or dramatic public display. As per the dictionary, this is the meaning of the word.To me, right now, a spectacle means RRR (Rise, Roar, Revolt / Roudram Ranam Rudhiram). Tempted to the max with the publicity posters, teasers, trailers, interviews and what not...as well as SS Rajamouli's previous blockbusters like Chatrapathi, Vikramarkudu, Magadheera, Eega, Bahubali 1 & 2, I had boarded the hype bandwagon along with others. While sitting in the dark, in Screen 1, the biggest of the lot, in Novo Cinemas, Ibn Batuta Mall, Dubai, I awaited with a lot of anxiety to witness Rajamouli's caged beauty of a movie! But even after watching countless number of movies of all genres and many languages, I still wasn't ready for what he unleashed onto the screen! The hype was real! RRR lived upto it and more! It's a kind of Magnum Opus that could be pulled off by Rajamouli only! That too with a budget of 550 Crores!Usually being an immensely patient man, I showed no signs of that when booking a ticket for the movie. Yes, I wanted to watch the Telugu version, for which I would have to read the English subtitles (and miss few scenes here and there!). But due to the fact that both the Telugu and Tamil versions were releasing only a day later, I booked for the Hindi version which came out on 24th here. And I have no problem in understanding Hindi. Now I didn't just blindly take that decision and I did do my homework. I found out that both ""Ram Charan"" and ""Junior NTR"" had dubbed in their own voices for the Hindi version. That convinced me that my decision to watch the Hindi version was right. All I wanted was the two heroes to belt out dialogues in their own deep strong voices. Great! Settled! Nothing else mattered as I knew that Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt would obviously dub in their own voices for this version and I already really enjoyed the songs in Hindi as well.In RRR, Ram Charan and Jr NTR play revolutionaries Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, respectively. In real life, they were two tribal leaders & revolutionaries who had put up a tough resistance against the British. They lived around the same time period from 1897 to 1940 in Andhra Pradesh. Both of them were killed in different years and it is not known for sure if they did actually meet each other, though they both might have known about the other's existence and freedom struggle. Rajamouli begins the movie in chapters - the story, the fire, the water. Thus giving us the film's context and introducing it's heroes Bheem (NTR) and Ram (Ram Charan), where Ram, the angry young Officer is like Fire and Bheem, the innocent Gond tribal, is like Water. What happens when fire and water collide? Is one consumed by the other or can they co-exist? You have to watch the movie to know about that!It's a fictional story, a patriotic saga, set in British India (Delhi) of the 1920s. The movie is epic. It has mythological connections (With Ramayana and Mahabharata), it's got superhero genre and scale of action and finally it is also about patriotism, love and brotherhood. The bromance between Ram and Bheem is so beautifully depicted that we root for both of them. We want them to win, we get heartbroken when they part ways, we desperately want them to reunite and return for the mind boggling finale war!The first half is excellent. Every scene exuded grandeur. After the initial story is established, incredible introductions are given to both protagonists. That itself is a sight to behold. A scene around 20 mins before the interval (Interval block as they say) is where you as an audience goes... What the...! And then witness with an open mouth, the unbelievable visuals and actions on screen! Oh my God, did that scene make me jolt in my seat and sit upright! I read that this specific scene was shot in a span of 65 nights, costing 75 lakhs a day! I mean, wow...just wow!!! I don't think there has been such an interval block ever in Indian cinema. The mesmerizing second half has more drama, establishing and clearing certain questions the viewers would have and thus introducing Ajay Devgn's character as well as Alia Bhatt's. Hence the pacing changes for a bit but even that doesn't give the audience a dull moment. The 3 hours and 2 minute runtime feels like a 1 hour and 90 minutes. I never felt that the movie is being unnecessarily stretched out. Ajay had an extended cameo and he was solid in his performance. Alia as Ramaraju's fiancé Sita, did well as always but she had very less screen time and I was disappointed for that. Rajamouli did say that these two actors are playing cameos. But the way they used her in promotions, you think she would have a meatier role and extended screen time! You get to see Shriya Saran after a long time, as Ajay's wife. Again she too has very less screen time. But she did well too with what was given to her. A few others in the cast is , Thor and Punisher: War Zone star Ray Stevenson as a tyrant British military general Scott, with Alison Doody of A View to a Kill and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, as his wife. Ray was pretty fierce in his character but I still felt like he did not do a good job. Alison Doody was quite over the top. Being a seasoned actress, I guess it's the lines given to her that made her ham a lot! There is also Olivia Morris who plays Jennifer who has affections for Komaran Bheem. She actually gave a pretty good performance and is pleasing to the eyes as well. The Brits are mostly shown as violent, unsympathetic and hateful people barring Olivia. Which reminded me of Rachel Shelley in Lagaan. The finale is mind boggling, to say the least. This movie is a visual treat to the max.All said and done, I have to talk about the elephant in the room. The larger than life characterizations and super human strength the two protagonists have.You can look at this in two ways. The traditional outlook that they are mere human beings and then question the director's choice of unbelievable and over the top action scene visualisations, protagonists getting hurt, rising up again without any effect of their previous wounds and so on...! This is nuts, funny, I can't buy this...would go the comments! But then I say you are watching the wrong movie and you do not know anything about Rajamouli's school of movie making. Now if you know about Rajamouli's filmography, you will actually applaud at his audacity to make super humans out of two very real freedom fighters, thus giving them a wider appeal and recognition amongst the ignorant movie goers and masses who probably never even knew of these two revolutionaries except maybe the history buffs and people hailing from Andhra Pradesh. I never knew or read about these two freedom fighters until now. Once you agree to this, then you are in for the roller coaster ride! Full on! The suspension of disbelief will still be there but it's not going to matter with the immense adrenaline pumping from the characters' veins to yours!Brace Yourself for Ram & Bheem....these words in the film's trailers are actually preparing you for this power packed unstoppable spectacle, that has awesome cinematography (camera work is astounding), unbelievable crowd scenes, pretty good CGI (Scenes with the Tiger, wolf and certain other ones), great sound effects and massive, beautiful set design and some super talented actors with superlative performances. Rajamouli, once again succeeds in creating an out and out commercial movie oozing with drama, action, comedy, superb songs and dance. And this time, Patriotism as well.The story is by Rajamouli's father K. V. Vijayendra Prasad. You might be surprised to know that K. V. Vijayendra Prasad was the writer for both Bajrangi Bhaijaan and Manikarnika as well. A well written screenplay makes for smooth viewing without any lag. Veteran Editor A. Sreekar Prasad excels in giving us a fast paced movie. Music by M. M. Keeravani is melodious and foot tapping. BGM again by him lifted the movie and it's dramatic and action sequences to another level altogether! The song 'Nacho Nacho' is sung by Vishal Mishra and Rahul Sipligunj. The song is choreographed by Prem Rakshith. This song sequence is a treat for the eyes and ears. A dance off with the Brits was just awesome and it was a showcase for the tremendous ability Ram Charan and Junior NTR has in dancing. Their agility, synchronization....outstanding! The friendship song was sweet! 90s kids will remember a popular Bollywood ""M. M. Keeravani / M. M Kreem"" song from a Mahesh Bhatt movie called Criminal (remake of Harrison Ford's ""The Fugitive"")
Tu Mile Dil Khile.... Which I think was sung by Kumar Sanu and Kerala's very own Chitra. The initial music and female vocals of that song were ""inspired"" from Age of Loneliness by Enigma. That's another matter altogether! It still was damn good!VFX for the most part was very good. There are one or two scenes where you really know the CGI wasn't that great but for a fraction of what is spent in Hollywood (even with such a big budget) I'll say it's fine! They had SRK's Red Chillies Vfx as well as others behind it. Hence the superior quality! Slow motion was used well and at the right moments!Not taking away anything from Junior NTR, but Ram Charan got the meatier role here, I feel. They both were really very good in their performances and transformations. There was a lot of blood and gore, even stylized versions of bloodshed and all. Kids would be better off watching the movie with their Parents.Whether you are fans of Ram Charan and Junior NTR or not, do not miss this visual treat. It's a Rajamouli epic and I congratulate him for his vision and conviction in bringing this to life. No easy feat! Enjoy!",9/10,positive

hafiznumair,"With a long and enjoyable duration of +3 hours, RRR by the all-famous S. S. Rajamouli is a masterpiece from the ever-growing Tamil/Bollywood industry. Talking about the plot, it takes you back to the era of British rule in the Sub-continent and all the oppression that occurred. Although the story is rich and just keeps you on edge, what surprised me the most was the use of Symbolism and VFX quality, and of course the crazy Naatu Naatu sequence. The use of Fire and water as the ever-going rivals in the history of mankind and how each person is represented as an idea rather than just a face on the screen is just unbelievably good. Talking about the technical side, the highlights were the beautiful environments, castles, all the wildlife and their movement, plus the cinematography and slow-mo shots (which did remind me of Zack Snyder a lot!). How all the dots connect in the end provides for a very satisfying conclusion which is suppose to be a tribute to all the freedom fighters of the sub-continent.Pros:
Rich Story.Amazing Cinematography & VFX.Amazing use of Symbolism & MetaphorsCons:

cchallenbeck,"With so many movies coming out every year it's easy to miss out on gems like this one. Luckily it has garnered a lot of attention and it was easier to suggest to watch after being nominated for an Oscar. It really does live up to the hype and there's a reason top directors are raving about it. It is Bollywood in its technical sense, but it is so much more with its over the top action and one of the greatest bromances of the ages. Since it is in essence a bollywood film it is fairly long at just over 3hr, there are several musical numbers (all of which we enjoyed thoroughly and still singing a day after), and there's some unnecessary exposition that can get into trope territory, but nothing atrocious or that stands out from the rest of the over the top almost campy vibe. It may not be perfect for all audiences but I think most will enjoy it. When my wife and I started it we were worried about making it through the run time, but we were surprised how interesting and fun the whole movie was. There were several times that I thought I was watching the best scene and it just kept getting better all the way through. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a fun epic to get lost in. And if u can't make it through in one sitting there is a good stopping place around the half way mark.9.1/10.",9/10,positive

The story, the music and songs, the direction and the acting, everything is a solid 10/10.",10/10,positive

phanivvaneela,There are so many elements in the movie that one would have thought even this would be made in 2 parts. Thanks it wasn't we got value for our money in a single film. About a dozen highlight scenes. Emotional gripping story line and wonderful performances. For me NTR takes the show away not only by outperforming but by giving ample space for others to perform. Finally Indian cinema is looking back at its cultural roots for new inspirations rather than looking at West. I hope this trend continues and many more Bharatiya stories find its way on silver screen. Believe me there are many more epics stories to come from Bharat not to mention the Biggest epic in the world the Mahabharata. Jakanna we pray to God that you remain healthy and fullfill the devine task of showing Bharatiya culture and Emotions on silver screen. Dandaloo Anna!,10/10,positive

The scenes are so long like the opening scene for Ram Charan to catch one guy in huge gathering...So dumb!!This movie is so animated, good for kids to watch, my younger kid liked the movie.

neelampatel-29730,"Alluri Sita Ramaraju n Khomuram Bheem were simple but PERFECT! Our Ram Charan Tej and Nandamuri Taraka Ramarao lived up to their namesakes and gone even beyond. They gave performances of a lifetime! Tarak anna portrayed the emotion-packed Bheem and his innocent eyes with such heft. Charan anna depicted rage, superiority and resilience with immense nuance. Both complement each other beautifully but for some reason that 0.00000001 edge, I feel like Ram took. This is coming from an unbiased standpoint since I'm an NTR fan first and an RC fan second BUT Ram Charan has scaled in such a way he deserves that praise. He has come a long way and improved like crazy. There is a certain nuance to his acting that can't be beat. NTR as usual delivered perfectly without missing a SINGLE beat.Overall, the themes of the film (such as Brotherhood, Persistence and Hope) were consistent and very human, rendering the emotional connect that much more real. Finally, the Hindu Mythology parallels and symbolisms were seamlessly embedded in RRR, enhancing the nativity of OUR Alluri Sita Ramaraju n Khomuram Bheem revolution.10/5 speaking as a fan and 4.8/5 speaking critically and unbiased. Jakkannas vision and effort deserves all the praise. Exceeded my expectations!",10/10,positive

The story telling is poor. It doesn't hold or captivate you. The movie just becomes boring after the first 30 minutes. In fact it becomes non nonsensical after that. Things become so unbelievable and stupid that you never get involved at any time in the film. It is shocking that the same director has made Baahubali - one of the most iconic films in India. Very disappointing movie, not recommended at all.",3/10,negative

cinemapersonified,"Rating: 8.5
Overall, a Telugu movie that does falter a bit from the given Telugu tropes, but overall transcends Tollywood as Rajamouli builds from the progress made from Baahubali to show what Telugu filmmaking can be as he creates a well digestible Epic that is driven by the performances of the two leads, good writing, and technical achievements in order to show India can stand on the same footing as the Western world in making films.Good to Very Good Direction (Did a very good job on a grad scale in creating a Telugu epic that is very watchable from a large scale audience, got the most out of his actors and commanded lead very well in helping drive the story forward), Decent to Pretty Good Acting (Good to Very Good from N. T. Rama Rao Jr. (Was very typical like other Telugu movies, but he does show some more range than I thought he ever could; really commands lead throughout the movie and does a good job in helping drive the story forward), Good from Ram Charan (Plays his character very well as it is one filled with depth and range), Pretty Good from Ajay Devgn, Pretty Good from Alia Bhatt, Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (very typical of the white actors as well as extras in Indian movies)), Very Good Story (An actually captivating story that inspires patriotism as well as does a good job in laying out elements very nicely and showing what the characters want towards the end (though does falter a bit from the typical Telugu tropes)), Good Screenplay (For a Telugu script, it does not fall too much into the cliches of dialog (though there are many moments when it does) as the writing makes sense; the symbolism and the foreshadowing of the movie is actually surprisingly good for a Telugu movie), Good Score/Great Soundtrack (Very Good use of songs to help in telling the story (does not seem forced like in other Indian movies of the past)), Very Good Cinematography, Good Sound, Very Good Editing, Great Visual Effects (Really shows how far Telugu movies have come in the technology they have to tell stories), Very Good Production Design (Really helps in setting the scene), Very Good Costumes (Helped with setting the time period, as well as the difference between the lower and higher classes), Plot Structure was laid out very nicely and it felt like all the elements of the plot were building off of each other, Pacing was good (especially for the long runtime as it felt like nothing was dragging as the length was used effectively to tell the story), Climax was very typical of an action sequence in a telugu movie (but was still very enjoyable), Tone was very typical to that of Telugu Epics (but it does contain flavors of patriotism and the wanting independence trope)",8/10,positive

Full of emotions, action, story, energy and music
I enjoyed the whole film and the plot is very good. The British era depiction is also solid. I just have a problem with the film, not my but all my friends who watched RRR that the ending was weak
The action felt flat as Ram gets completely cured after 2min if applying some quick natural remedy of medecine, the way bhim hits ram thinking that ram was aiming for his sister but actually he was saving him... These things are very well written but by the end it didn't last an inpression. And the movie is too long as well
So i would have loved it if the movie ended after bhin escapibg and a spoiler scene of ram in jail and bhim meeting sita.. Another 1hr30min long movie couldve been adapted of that last 20min scene.That's my only concern. Still the movie is great. But Bahubali 2 is still better....",9/10,positive

Of course, there are some ridiculous scenes in the movie, but this is the feature of Indian movies. Hindu movies are often unrealistic or funny. The illogical scenes are mostly fight scenes. But this is a good movie because it uses astonishing animations in both the dance scenes and the battle scenes. The British are shown as very bad in the movie. They are very right about this because the British people made the Hindus suffer a lot. In this sense, we can say that the film also has a political aspect.

Hyped too much. First half is good. You looses interest in second half. Alia bhat is wasted with not so important character. I think 10/10 is given by hardcore fans of Jr. NTR and Charan. But i am a fan of film making so i expect good cinema from Rajamouli. Not recommended if tickets are blacked or expensive. Rajamouli has set a bench mark with Bahubali. So good cinema is expected.In some scene i felt i am watching a low graphic game. But some scene are iconic.,5/10,positive

It's refreshing to know there is still thought-provoking cinema being produced out there that doesn't rely on sex or extensive crude humor to sell. What a powerful tale the director weaves, and only more powerful the more you learn of the religious history surrounding the protagonists. Surprisingly for its length, neither time did the movie ever feel like it dragged, but it will tug at your heart strings every time. Amazing acting and choreography, an intense and uniquely vibrant soundtrack, protagonists with some complexity and a great script to work with, endearing and captivating motifs, seemingly mostly consistent set design for the era, and plenty of raw action with splashes of romance!

jboothmillard,"I literally only found out about this Indian film, one of the most expensive and highest grossing, when it became part of Awards Season, it looked super cool from the clips shown on a BBC review show. The title stands for Rise Roar Revolt. Basically, set during the British Empire ruling India in the early 20th century, in 1920, Governor Scott Buxton (Ray Stevenson) and his wife Catherine (Alison Doody) are visiting a forest in Adilabad, inhabited by the Gond tribe. There, they abduct an artistically talented young girl named Malli (Twinkle Sharma) and severely injure her mother Loki (Ahmareen Anjum). Meanwhile, the tribe's guardian Komaram Bheem (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.) is hunting in the jungle when he encounters an aggressive tiger, there is a long pursuit until he eventually defeats the beast. Returning to the tribe, Bheem is enraged by the kidnapping of Malli and embarks for Delhi to rescue her, disguising himself as a Muslim named Akhtar. The Nizamate of Hyderabad gets sympathetic to the British Raj (the British Crown rule in India) and warns Scott's office of the impending danger. Undeterred, Catherine enlists ambitious Indian Imperial Police officer Alluri Sitarama Raju, aka A. Rama Raju (Ram Charan) to put an end to the threat. Raju becomes part of a large-scale battle between the warring sides. Raju and his uncle Venkateswarulu (Samuthirakani) attend several pro-independence gatherings where he pretends to support independence. Bheem's gullible aide Lacchu (Rahul Ramakrishna) believes Raju's ruse, where he tries to recruit him into Bheem's plot. Before taking Raju to Bheem, Lacchu discovers Raju's identity and flees. Shortly after, Bheem and Raju encounter each other, unaware of their opposing allegiances. They are brought together when a little boy in a boat is endangered by a train caught on a fire and explosion causes the bridge to collapse. They work together to save the boy from the train wreck and become close friends. Raju assists Bheem in getting romantically closer with Scott's niece Jenny (Olivia Morris), unaware that Bheem's is planning to infiltrate Scott's residence. When Jenny takes Bheem with her to the house, Bheem finds the room where Malli is being held captive and promises to set her free. Raju locates Lacchu and apprehends him. While being interrogated, Lacchu captures and sets a venomous snake onto Raju which attacks him. He then warns him of his imminent death and that the antidote is only known to the Gonds. Raju is dazed and approaches Bheem who immediately helps him. Noticing similar religious features between Lacchu and Bheem, Raju deduces his true intentions. However, Bheem himself divulges his tribal identity and his mission, unaware of Raju's true identity. During an event where Scott is being honoured, Bheem's men barge into his residence with a lorry filled with wild animals, causing chaos among the guests. The animals attack Scott's guards, allowing Bheem to briefly gain an advantage. However, Raju arrives and they fight briefly, but Bheem sees Scott threatening to kill Malli and is forced to give up. Raju is promoted for thwarting Bheem, although he is racked with guilt for his actions, recalling his pro-nationalistic background and his alter-ego as a mole within the police. He wanted a promotion to gain access to gun shipments to smuggle to his village and fulfil the promise he made to his dying revolutionary father Alluri Venkatarama Raju (Ajay Devgn). At Bheem's public flogging, Raju tries to persuade him to renounce his actions, but he chooses to be whipped instead. Bheem sings in defiance of his injuries, encouraging the assembled crowd into rebellion. Raju is further enlightened by the riot, who finally recognises his reckless actions. Determined to save Bheem, Raju persuades Scott to execute Bheem in secret, while an ambush is prepared to rescue him. However, Scott figures out the scheme. While rescuing Malli from Scott's men, Raju is seriously injured. After freeing himself, Bheem mistakes Raju's actions as an attempt to kill Malli. Raju interrupts him, hits him on the head and escapes with Malli, resulting in getting captured. Months later, Bheem and Malli are hiding in Hathras with his group, but they are by the colonial authorities. Bheem narrowly avoids being exposed when Raju's fiancée Sita (Alia Bhatt) tries to make the people leave due to a fictitious smallpox epidemic. Unaware of Bheem's identity, she reveals Raju's anti-colonial objectives and his impending execution. Disappointed realising his foolishness, Bheem vows to save Raju. With the assistance of a sympathetic Jenny, Bheem infiltrates the barracks where Raju is detained and frees him. The pair retreat to a nearby forest, where they decimate soldiers with a longbow taken from a Rama shrine and a spear. Taking the fight to Scott, they hurl a flaming motorcycle into the artillery of the barracks, setting it on fire. Bheem steals a stockpile of guns for Raju before the barracks are destroyed. The subsequent explosion kills many soldiers and Catherine. A wounded Scott is cornered, Raju has Bheem execute him with a British rifle, fulfilling their respective objectives. Ram is reunited with Sita, and Bheem is reunited with Jenny and his family. The mark the success and completion of the mission, Raju asks Bheem to make a wish he can grant. Bheem asks Raju to provide education for him and his community. Also starring Shriya Saran as Sarojini, Mark Bennington as Cunningham, Varun Buddhadev as Young Raju, and Spandan Chaturvedi as Young Sita. The story revolves around two legendary revolutionary figures, a fearless warrior and a steely cop, and their journeys during the time of pre-independent India, it doesn't really matter however if you cannot follow everything going on. It is filmed and edited in a way that makes it appear almost constantly in fast-forward. Very similar in style to The Matrix with phenomenal special effects, visuals and stunt work, eye-catching colour and choreography, and fabulously over-the-top fights and violence. The highlights are the opening brawl, the tiger chase through the jungle, the train explosion and bridge rescue, the ""Naatu Naatu"" sequence, and the climactic explosive fight featuring a motobike. It very rarely slows down during its three-hour runtime, it has a brilliant score by M. M. Keeravani, including the energetic song and dance sequences, and breath-taking direction by S. S. Rajamouli, it is a stupendous and high-recommended epic action drama. It won the Oscar for Best Original Song for ""Naatu Naatu"" (it also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Non-English Language. Very good!",8/10,positive

And also the story was something new rather then same old rubbish Bollywood stuff. The graphics ware on another level. Tollywood had provided that Bollywood can never come close to it I have never seen any other indian movie expect Bahubali at this level.

It echoes commitment to the tribal group of its ethos of wanting to be united and together no matter what the circumstances .For a simple story line, 3 hours 15 minutes is too long,There is no humor, weak development of characters and most importantly this is not even based on a real story!I was bored, with this chewing gum of a movieRaj mouli focusedon making money with smart casting to cater to pan IndiaI liked the dance with the two leads, the grandeur of the sets and popcorn. 3 stars without popcorn.",4/10,positive

The cinematography was good, the editing sometimes really good and sometimes clumsy. The visual effects, a main protagonist in this film, was good and mediocre at the same time.

Padrion,"Well this is a though one to judge. On one hand it features some really awesome over the top action scenes and iconic camera shots, on the other hand the pacing is off. Way off. Considering how little plot there is, the movie is just too long and when you think it finally reached its climax you realize you're in for another hour and now get the watch the backstory of your second main character. At that point you likely figured out most of it anyway.Seriously, as a 3-part television mini series this would have made much more sense and the cheap CGI wouldn't be as glaring in that format.

shinrisen,"RRR serves it's entire plot on a platter during it's opening scene, in which cartoonishly evil smug British imperialist army guy and his wife abduct a young tribal girl from her village because she sings nice. A few moments later the mustache twirling villain stops a soldier from shooting the mother of the girl, reminding him that the price of English bullets is too high to be wasted on 'brown rubbish' (meaning the woman). That's about the subtility one can get out of 'RRR'.But let's face it, the plot, characters and everything else in it is there only to serve the action scenes, fueled by tons of moustaches and explosions and CGI animals and punches and karate kicks and motorcycles and horses and men screaming with lots of testosterone and YEAAAA uuuuuhhhh!!! AUUGHGHHHH HAAYAAAA that kind of stuff. Which was hilariously entertaining at first when it sort of overwhelmed me with how over the top it was. This was still at the point at which I wasn't sure the movie was a parody of 'big bombastic moustachio films' that maybe preceded this one? During my three hours with this movie I've come to believe that no, it's not a parody, but as I have no experience in Bollywood cinema I might be wrong.I suppose the film is about brotherhood, about friendship, about bromances, about moustachios. I'm not sure I could really care about much of it after a few hours. After the halfway point I was pretty sure I've had all I could've wanted from the film, but my susceptibility for the sunk cost fallacy kept me going for the other half as well (funny how that works). The village girl gets rescued by her bro but her bro made a bro for life with the other moustachio man who also has a grudge against the British and together they release tons of CGI animals and punch each other and the animals and the British all into a pulp. Then they sing a song about it and that's pretty much the movie.The lead actors both put down great performances and I can't help but feel that they they, the sets, costumes, extra's and everything could've been utilized a lot better if the film had any plot. Sadly, this film has more moustachios than plot.5/10.",5/10,positive

ASuiGeneris,"Obviously only my opinion, but making a film primarily to flaunt special effects and supposedly great musical tunes, sacrificing a coherent, plausible story, character development, and dragging out a film to an unnecessary three hours, does not equate such rave reviews. Furthermore, the special effects were not even superior. The animals and other animation was clearly fake. I cannot understand why this is such a widely lauded film, critically acclaimed almost unanimously. Not to mention it seeing multiple records for box office success, although that is more understandable than the critical acclaim received.Maybe something to do with the lyrics being lost in translation, but the Academy Award winning song was slightly above average at best. Admittedly, the accompanying battle scene was exemplary, but that should not be considered in the evaluation for best song. The performances were fine. Everything was average or slightly above average, but weighed alongside the endless seeming runtime, overdone special effects, and sans a good story, it means little.Would recommend not watching this, but apparently I am in the vast minority here in that everything I disliked is precisely what most other viewers were impressed with here. Possibly because I cannot relate to the underlying nationalist Indian pride, nor the obvious borrowing from the myth Rama, the seventh incarnation of the god Vishnu (names included), but I theorize a large part of audience adoration (possibly subconscious) can be attributed to the pro gun, pro war, pro violence stance taken. Would even go so far as to say pro discrimination, with the representation (or misrepresentation) in regards to the caste system, politics, and religion.Yes, there were several entertaining action sequences, including admittedly creative and innovative directorial choices, but that is what YouTube clips are for. It does not necessitate being forced to endure three hours that includes subpar filler nonsense!* Vague Spoilers *Last but certainly not the least flaw with this film is that the multiple character motivation and modus operandi shifts (in both the protagonists), would have been much more believable if they were accompanied by improved character development, less capricious, less extreme, and less frequent. From such deadly, inhumanely savage violence towards each other to sacrificing everything near and dear including their lives for each other, even in the name of national pride versus friendship, would make much more sense in the hands of a more competent director and scriptwriter.",5/10,positive
chudasamadarshit,"RRR is 7/10 for me ( not the best film of 2022)
Rrr is good film and its very artistic yes I know every single detailing in rrr, the horse and bike metaphor, fire and water metaphor , Raju represents Lord Rama and Bhima represents Lord Hanuman, that is why in the last Bhima's character carries Raju on his shoulder which is inspired by ramayan, In the beginning, a little girl made a drawing on British queen's hand that drawing is refrence to Bahubali 1, but I don't think that Rrr is best film of 2022
Because I have many problems with rrr
1) many action sequences were there that I didn't quite believe example: bhim and bike action scene in climax, And I have the same problems with Rajamouli's other films as well,example: Bahubali 2 palm tree scene
I don't have any problem with over the top action sequences but some of scenes are very unconvincing for me,
( I didn't like these action scenes because of their choreography, And it is not that I dislike all the action scenes of RRR, I have also liked some of the action scenes of RRR, example=bheem introduction, interval fight scene, climax fight scene)
2) Rrr has the same stereotypical villain who we knew from the start that he is going to lose in the end,here I am talking about the character of the villain, I found the character of the villain very fake and cartoony,I did not feel any danger from it,The way he speaks the dialogues, it sounds fake,you can show cruelty in a better way like Tarantino did in inglorious bastards with Hans Landa, the way he delivers dialogues and manipulates people was mind-blowing, and another example was Leonardo DiCaprio in django unchained He was also a very cruel and over the top villain, but Leonardo DiCaprio's acting makes him a dangerous and unique antagonist ,He Really Feels Like A Direct Threat To Our Hero, and all this was missing in Rrr's villain,He never seems to be a direct threat to our heroes, I never thought that he would ever be able to defeat our heroes, in Bahubali bhallaldeva was very strong villain, that's why the Bettle of the last one seems very equal and interesting, but in rrr last Bettle was very well choreographed but it's very one-sided.3)in the beginning of the movie people started thinking that Ram is antivillain but then after interval it was found that Ram is also against British, This was a surprising twist for many people but not for me because I recognized this as soon as I saw the trailer, I did not find it so surprising because a big movie superstar can never be a villain in India. That's why only after watching the trailer, I realized that Raju will also be against the British government. And yes raju and bhim's friendship happened by just an event i mean such a deep friendship may take time,A movie based on such friendship will be unique for America,but it is very common in India.4) characters are to cartoony, Raju's character has some character development , But Bheem's character was very one-dimensional
RRR's characters lacks depth,
This is the condition of commercial movies in India, they don't understand the importance of character's depth, they don't understand the importance of a good villain in the movie,
There are too many characters like this in Indian movies, that's why I have lost interest in such movies and characters,
The same way you all are tired of the self-aware, cheeky characters of American superhero movies, in that same way, I am also tired of these types of one-dimensional characters in Indian movies.5) honestly in some scenes Rrr's CGI was not good
And I have problem with comedy in rrr, you will get to she this in many indian films that a desi boy falls in love with a foreign girl ,but our desi boy does not know how to speak English which creates comedy, whole name pronouncing thing was so lame and such an old trick to create comedy
Finally I don't hate rrr it's better than other trash Indian comercial films like pathaan, kgf and pushpa but I don't think that Rrr is the best movie of 2022
Over all 7/10 for me

ukproject,"Decades ago my father used to get hold of Indian movies on VHS and back then most households were one TV homes. So we'd have to watch whatever it is our parents used to watch and I pretty much endured a constant stream of formulaic Bollywood crap.It didn't take long for me to realise that you could map out the entire plot of the movie within the first 15 minutes, unless of course you'd seen the VHS cover art in which case you could suss out the entire story line from that alone.Is it two brothers, or two best friends, or two characters from identical family backgrounds one of whom turns to crime and the other to law enforcement? Add in the obligatory romance, a badly choreographed fight scene with heads thrown back half a second before a punch is thrown, someones mother being killed with the hero yelling 'maaaaaaa', and some chreographed dance scenes ridiculously thrown in for no reason. Just imagine the UN security council breaking into a song and dance routine midway through discussing the war in Ukraine. That is what would happen in a Bollywood production of a UN security meeting.Anyway, after years of staying well away from Bollywood movies in a moment of weakness I thought I'd give RRR a chance as it seems everyone was talking about how great it was.Apart from some CGI, nothing has really changed. Even the storyline reminded roughly me of an Indian ripoff of 'Escape to Victory' which I think was redone with a Cricket match against the British. And even the CGI was meh! The tiger scene which everyone seemed to be raving about was laughable. While the detail of the CGI was good, the movements were cartoonish.There is nothing new to see here unless you've never seen a Bollywood production before in which case you may end up enjoying it for it's novelty value.The IMDB rating is obviously bumped up by the number of Indian reviewers marking this movie as a 10, which RRR most certainly isn't.So while my rating of 1 may be abit too low, it's justified in response to the ridiculous 10 ratings it has received.",1/10,positive

ThurstonHunger,"...stuntmen and CGI artists.My son suggested watching this, and we knew little about it. Right from the outset with a sad song setting up one of the crises of the film, I wondered out loud if there would be a dance sequence in this. Long ago (read Before Youtube), I used to love to watch ""Namaste America"" just to see *and hear* highlights from Bollywood's best of the best.Sure enough RRR delivers a dance-off that would make Zoolander cry tears of joy :)As for the film, at three hours we split it over two nights. The first part had more pizzazz for us, including a motorcycle and horse scene the ignites a fiery bromance. Helluva meet cute for brutes. And it's not just a bromance, it's a foe-mance too...or is it?The second half drags a little but does involve a massive fight scene, where the powers of stuntmen and cgi workers combine to deliver blow after blow. My kid is about to exit his teenage years, for younger viewers, I'd give pause on some of the gory glorification.For what it's worth, my colonial complexion comes with thick enough skin to not get hung up on the very very bad white folks. Aren't non-fiction ""news shows"" here in the US are far more troubling? I wonder if those shows and this movie share some funding from the NRA.That said, there is one scene involving a suicide bombing of sorts, and it definitely had me sneak a sideways glance at my son.

""RRR"" has none of themThe problem with the film is that Rajamouli takes the names of the real-life freedom warriors and weaves his fictional tale. Not a single scene is relevant to history. Plus, Bheem's aim of saving a girl who was taken by the British officers after being impressed with her tattoo-making skills looks very weak.Why would all British officers fight against Bheem just for a girl who makes tattoos?

Movie_Rating_n_Ranking,"RRR is the very definition of spectacularity, but multiplied by a thousand. And I say it both ways, for better and for worse, because obviously the filmmakers chose this concept over many other things, they chose to surprise the viewer with action sequences taken from the imaginary movie buff, where you just want to see fights, blood, sweat, bullets, explosions and if it's shown in slow motion, all the better. The film achieves its goal, of that there is no doubt. There are action scenes that I have never seen in any other movie and I was quite entertained. The bad thing is that all this bet on the spectacular sacrifices many technical aspects that I am sure that the friends of India are capable of doing without any problem. This film has gross errors in editing, sound editing, continuity and a long etcetera, just to favor the visual spectacle present in most of the film. The performances are aimed at its essence, falling all the time into exaggeration. The script is generic, predictable and sometimes boring. Finally, the length of the film is simply too long. It doesn't hold up for a movie of this genre.Overall, I was entertained and had a lot of fun with the overdose of action, but the glitches are an impossible distraction to ignore.",5/10,positive

The 2 protagonists kill about 10-20 Brits but loads of Indians in over the top action. Special effects are cheesy and the action has no let up. It is a mindless dumb action especially post the party scene where there are animals unleashed on the Brits. So they need animals to create chaos and then why not the same in climax?Overall cgi is horrible, sound effects are good and the nacho nacho song is spirited but other than that and Olivia Morris, this movie is really boring and repetitive in over the top action.Rotten, Repetitive and Ridiculous, the only star is for the British actress, Olivia Morris.

In one scene hero is almost over powering an elephant but in the next scene he cant even jump. Even bollywood is not that ahead from south india.

prayagsuthar,"I've heard a lot of people say that this is a great movie, just with overexaggerated scenes. Indeed, there is a lot of hyperbole, but it doesn't help the film's case in my eyes.The movie gets credit for the amazing CGI; you can tell what scenes are 3D, especially with the animals, but it's a level of 3D quality unique in Indian movies. It also has amazing songs, although they often feel forced in the context of the movie. And there's the moving scenes of Malli's enslavement, which are a visual portrayal of just how twisted slavery is.But that's about it for the good points. It's really not as good of a movie as they say.The overdone scenes, like with blood dripping into Raju's eye, or the one where he manages to punch gaping holes into a wall, just felt so ridiculous. Hyperbole is not uncommon for Indian fight scenes, and fight scenes are not uncommon for Indian movies. But this movie takes the amount of violence to another level.And the entire story operates on conveniences. There were far too many contrivances to count, like Raju and Bheem's friendship suddenly just happening and substituting real character development with a song, the language barrier between Bheem and Jenny conveniently disappearing after the dance. Alia Bhatt is just there, and I didn't know why she was there until the scene where she says ""vande mataram,"" but that was the only scene where it made sense. The flat overacting, especially for the British characters, doesn't make up for any of this.And those are only minor grievances! The worst offense was how Raju was magically inspired by Bheem's singing while he was being flogged, and for the rest of the movie he just went ""okay, no more guns! Oh, but we can still fight and break people's bones and do murder. Nonviolence? What's that?""The plot swings from contrivance to contrivance, and the messaging of ""eye-for-an-eye"" is appalling; isn't this the country of Mahatma Gandhi, who helped achieve India's independence through nonviolence?! In a section of the movie, there are scenes where a child is encouraged to use a gun! To kill!!! And it's practically glorified!!!!! The British characters were given lines with quite a lot of disgusting imagery, but nobody in this movie is not guilty of bloodthirst.I was also bothered by the severe representation issues. One of them was the extremely superficial characterizations of people solely based on their race/nationality (i.e. All the white people are cruel, all the Indians are perfect); although I'll let that slide because that makes sense for the premise of the movie. What's really shocking, though, is that even though Akhtar (Bheem's cover identity) was supposed to be Muslim, he participates in several Hindu rituals, even recalling ""Ram and Sita"" but never mentioning a single thing about Islam. The only characteristics of his Muslim act are that he has a cap and carries meat in one scene; it's so blatantly stereotypical.I'm very confident that the only reason this movie was so popular was due to the nationalistic appeal, same with The Kashmir Files (which was written by a director who had only directed flops up to that point, and which also has a nationalistic agenda) and Kantara (which depicts Lord Shiv condoning violence, what!!!). There's nothing wrong with national pride; but this movie is so flat, with such a flimsy plot, no nuance, and questionable themes, that it can hardly be justified.",5/10,negative

Its starts ok, But, then turns ridiculous, Especially the ""Desi Nach"" dance against Britishers. What was that??

Anton_Klink,"Let's start with the positives.Most of the action scenes are absolutely glorious and some of the most inventive and exhilarating ever put to screen.Same goes for the dance numbers, which are a catchy explosion of color, movement and wonderful choreography.Extremely charismatic leads all around (except for the two white British ladies, but I'll get to that later). The stunts, action scenes and dance numbers performed by the male leads are simply superb. Even the late Roy Stevenson chews the scenery as the evil governor.Now the negatives.The British villains are laughably and ridiculously evil and cartoonish. With the movie so clearly stacked against them, it created the opposite effect from the intended one, so I actually ended up rooting for them instead of the heroes. Probably not what the film-makers intended or expected.Even the one positive British character, the love interest of one of the heroes, is just a shallow two-dimensional cutout and their love story has zero credibility or believability.To Western sensibilities, this movie is very clearly a gay love story - a notion, which Indian audiences seem to take offense with. I know the intention was to show a strong male friendship but I guess it comes down to cultural differences on how male friendship is perceived. The supposed love interests of both heroes are there just as token characters with no depth at all, whereas the strong emotional bond, intense ""brotherly"" love, the longing looks, the caressing, the physical contact and dancing between the leads throughout the movie suggests way more than just friendship. I only put this down under negatives, as both the film-makers and initial intended target audience seem to be shocked by the suggestion, but honestly, this movie is just as gay if not even more than ""Rocketman"", ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Moonlight"", ""Call Me By Your Name"", ""Power of the Dog"", ""Brokeback Mountain"" etc.In between the action, the constant emotionally manipulative tear-jerking and insufferable melodrama with endless slow-motion panning shots of the actors and their eyes yet again about to burst with streams of tears due to outrage and injustice caused by the cartoonishly evil British colonists just made me want to throw things at the screen.Endless proto-fascist military propaganda with no Gandhi-like peaceful protest anywhere in sight. In fact, I don't think Gandhi was mentioned even once, even though the final dance number wheeled out countless images of various other apparently nationalist historical figures. I guess Gandhi's peaceful policies did not sit well with the militaristic propaganda aims of the movie, so he was swiftly sidelined.The unequal statuses of the two leads, with one being a Hindu warrior and hero with a grand vision and the other being a short-sighted brute tribesman who is initially pretending to be Muslim (but to the relief of everyone in the movie, ""thankfully"" is not) and who by the end of the movie ends up asking for wisdom and guidance from the first. Looks like the caste-system is alive and well.I approached the movie with tepid anticipation but apart from the dance and action scenes and the charismatic leads, the movie was otherwise a sour disappointment. Without the dance and action scenes, I might have rated the movie 2 or 3 out of 10, but since the action and dance choreography were undoubtedly some of the best I have ever seen, it pulled this otherwise melodramatic, militaristic, nationalistic, proto-fascist tear-jerker out of the gutter so 5 out of 10 stars from me.",5/10,positive

The movie was way too long. The physics were unbelievable and even if so, it wasn't anything new. Rohit Shetty is a good examples of using over the top fight scenes and making it entertaining and also using the same slo-mo but he does it better in this movies than what they did in RRR. The fight scenes were so dull, I'd pick Rohits any day over this. Kinda disappointed in Rajmouli, since I loved action scenes in Baahubali.I wish the movie was a love story of ram and shyam, it would have made for a great twist than a regular cringey bromance angle. It's a bit too cringey and corny, unbelievable too.

khadar-63892,"#RRRMovie was not only underwhelming but also disappointing. Was a cluster of both technical and creative flaws. I was luck to watch the movie in Telugu to witness senseless narration where the protagonist raging non-Telugu speaking bystanders with Telugu folk songs.The movie was dominated with loud sound and unnecessary actions (I understand, if there is nothing else to show, use VFX as safety).The worst part is the music. For a movie of a scale like this, why can't SS Rajamouli look beyond archaic M. M Keeravani, seriously? The music was as disappointing as in #Bhahubali. I mean, have to ever heard anyone playing/listening to Bhabubali (now RRR) songs in a party, family gathering, or an individual chilling out in a park? I pay to get entertained, the production house keeping the money in-house ain't gonna cut it (for context: Keeravani and Rajamouli are cousins). The only song, 'Natu Natu' got popular because of Ram and NTR's dance. Just imagine this song without that dance! Bad, really bad.Ram Charan met the expectations as an under performer. Although, I must say, Jr. NTR was phenomenal. Perhaps the savior for the movie.SS Rajamouli is certainly a better movie director than a lot of others in the Telugu cinema industry. But, by no stretch a great one. Box-office collection does not bonify once talent. I would say, Trivikram and Sukumar are 'technically' more talented.#RRRMovie sheer disappointment.",1/10,positive

But in the movie, it is presented in unbelievably unrealistic way. Like always, gravity was missing and even basic logic was out of the picture. What we see on the screen is two guys, like in god mode, crunching down enemies one after another like its a peace of cake. They can lift 200kg motorbike like nothing, jump 100mts, carry another person on the back and do backflips, front flips and insane acrobatic movements like the gravity and weight doesn't affect them at all. Enemies lack aim and commonsense.

Perhaps it was 'realistic' but it struck us as a perverse wallow.After her child is brutally stolen: ""Don't waste a one pound sterling on a bullet for that bereaved mother!""

And the 2nd Half is Tarzan (in pants). It's so fun without any laugh to ask for. Ram charan as Alluri Sitaramaraju was a shocker, the climax fight was so fantasized and boring as the director jumped off to illusions. Ntr jr gave a explosive start fighting a tiger in the jungle but that's to it, as he almost disappeared in the rest of the film.Ajay devgan was not used to this talent and action was always short for his entry or screen time.

Falkner1976,"The show shouldn't justify stupidity. The special effects should not serve for a video game aesthetic. The search for blockbuster does not require this crude, childish, basic narrative.I tried to watch this movie as I have enjoyed Curtiz's Robin Hood. Robin Hood was also childish, exaggerated, and none of this prevented it from being a magnificent film. The key could be in taste, elegance and rhythm. Understated and never grossly over the top. It was a colorful fantasy. An assumedly youthful cinema that could be enjoyed by adults.But RRR does not work. It is cinema aimed at adults that would be ridiculous to a child. This kind of Captain Tsubasa with a background of struggles against the British empire ends up being laughable. I found it surprising and sad that history is treated in such a stupid, simplistic, childish and escapist way.Unfortunately, that trend of a certain Indian cinema triumphs, primary and basic characters, tacky and ostentatious aesthetics, emotional complexity typical of the worst adolescent literature. As in other big Indian productions, there is a basic problem, they seem anchored in the most surprisingly immature melodrama. We are not facing the cinema of Satyajit Ray exactly.Britons with comic cruelty steal girls for a few coins and beat begging women to death. Their wickedness is only comparable to their ridiculousness and intellectual, military, social and sexual inability, and makes them defenseless against the aim of an indian child, not to mention the heroic deeds of the protagonists.Visually it looks like a video game: wild animals, vegetation, everything seems to be made by computer, everything seems to float artificially in a kind of matrix universe.Deeply sexist, immature, devoid of taste and very tacky in its visual expression.",3/10,negative

captain_dimpf,"Truth be told. I didn't finish this movie. It's over three hours and so dull and predictable that I thought there was hardly any point in wasting any more of my precious time.I don't even know where to start. Probably with the culture shock. I tried to watch an Indian series once and couldn't do it because of the bad acting, but I realised now, it's probably not bad acting, it's just Indian acting and it is supposed to be that way. It reminds me a bit how acting in European films has been during the silent era. It's not very subtle and doesn't leave room for any ambiguity. Also the various stereotypes of heroes, villains and innocents are so old fashioned, it becomes unintentionally funny at times. I guess the Brits did some bad stuff, while they were over there, but this narrativ where every Brit is a sadistic and brutal moron whereas all Indians are brave and noble beings is laid on a bit thick. Turkish films are like that as well. To me it seems aimed an an audience who like their world to be very, very simple indeed.Also, and I say that as an editor, I found it clumsily edited. The overuse of slo-mo aside, to me there is no flow in the cut. Static frames are cut way too quick and movement very rarely picks up from where it was left off in the take before, thus even the carefully choreographed actions scenes seem eerily wooden. And they drag on forever.This is probably another specific Indian trait, seeng that 3 hour movies are totally common over there, but I found the pacing excruciatingly slow, because you always know what is going to happen next and you just sit there waiting for it to be over until you can't take it anymore.So much stuff here seems to be done just for the sake of it, regardless if it propels the story forward or not. The imagery is far to clean and you never have the feeling you are in India at the beginning of the last century. Instead you feel like you are in an endless propaganda commercial of 2022.

bertrandborn,"Extremely nationalistic film, depicting the British as evil, brutal and sadistic twits, while all Indians are benevolent and humble saints.It's understandable that India is happy to be rid of Colonialism, but depicting English people in such a derogative manner is somewhat bewildering and probably doesn't help ""past wounds to heal"" or progress global understanding and friendship, instead promoting vengeance and hatred. From that messaging standpoint its certainly not a good movie.On the pure entertainment side: the two main characters are fun (mr moustache, and the little bearded village dude) and the friendship vs. Tension between the two heroes with the double (triple) undercover identities is interesting across the film. The ""bromance"" and dance scenes are somewhat ridiculous, and the absurdly unrealistic action scenes and special effects are fun and fairly well made.Overall the film is a bit too long: starts of well and then at some point loses pace, randomly introducing new characters halfway through the film.. so after hour #2 a slight touch of boredom started to kick in.In summary: ok entertainment with some good attempts at epic scenes, but unpalatably nationalistic.",5/10,positive
muraleevaidya,"I was expecting a comic book movie before watching the movie. I was wrong. Comic characters have more strength and some application of logic.Plus: camera workMinus: Illogical and distasteful plot, Bahubali sets transposed with Victorian sets, Typical Tollywood music that is being claimed pan-IndianConclusion: Exhilarating sequences in a weak illogical plot. The A+ reviews are not to be believed. There are much better Indian movies that deserves the attention of Western audiences and not this junky!",4/10,positive
van-83714,"For the first half of the movie, a reasonable plot with the kidnapping of a Indian child by British aristocrats representing the key event. Acting, story line, and direction were upper tier initially. However, this changed in the second half of the movie when most of the British were portrayed as sadistic psychopaths who tried to find as many ways as possible to kill and dehumanize native Indians. A central protagonist's motivations made a jarring u-turn fairly late in the story. While the singing, dancing, and flexing of male muscles interspersed between battle scenes were not a big surprise, it was difficult to take the rebels seriously with this approach to entertainment. This movie compares poorly to the Bengali movie, Ghare-Baire, by Satyjit Ray. Ray's movie shows a much more sober approach to early efforts toward independence without dehumanizing any of the characters. It showed how different Indians chose to make progress toward independence without extreme hatred and large-scale bloodbaths. And no fun Tollywood singing and dancing.",4/10,negative
obarchechat,"It's pretty simple. There's a fight between one man and a mob at the beginning of the movie, 1 vs 300 hundreds (much more in fact but above 50, what's the difference?). After knocking out I don't know how many of them, he gets back behind the fence, hurt of course, but not that bad actually. When you start to include super heroes' performance in non super heroes movies, you're entering in the annoying and barely viewable zone as far as I'm concerned.",5/10,positive
christineballone,I started this film with high hopes because I like Bollywood fantasy movies. The first thing that threw me off was the white actress with all the plastic surgery in the beginning and then after a few minutes extreme violence occurs because the woman takes one Indian child away from mother and a British soldier kills the mother by hitting her head with big wooden stick! The British are shown as extremely violent people! So I went on Google and found out that this is basically a lie! We have to educate ourselves and not always accept what we see as the truth! Why can we not live together on this globe in peace and go ahead into the future as one and not always stir the sh...t and make people hate each other! I know I'm a dreamer but I call out to Netflix and movie makers who have the power to make this world a better place but instead concentrate on hate and violence! I love the Indian people and and all other people on this planet and implore everybody to think about the future of mankind and the planet!,4/10,negative
twkm05,I gave it a go having not watched a Bollywood movie in over 10years. Lasted about 35 minutes before I realised it wasn't going to get any better.How this movie is is top rated in multiple countries beg belief.The stereotypical English accents are painfully cringe. The acting is soap opera at best.Desperate attempt at CGI too. Keep an eye out for the tiger hair. It's literally a teddy bear haha.Overall cringe fest.Don't waste your time. This is not even a marmite movie. It's simply a terrible waste of time and shouldnt have ever been made. My decision to give an Indian movie a chance backfired spectacularly.0/10.,1/10,neutral
sunnynasik,"The animation of animals was very realistic, but the movie's storyline was very poor or I can say meaningless. The movie was all about action the direction was not practical like an individual beating an entire hoard of people alone was not practical at all. In my opinion, the movie was one time see and impractical.",5/10,negative
sahilbhardwaj-00643,Action wise ots good but story line it's worst..Better next time give something better with plot.. Story should be clear at least. Only enjoyed because coz ram charan was there.. 😭😭😭😭ram avatar.,5/10,positive
sunildatlacloud,"This movie is only for NTR and Ramcharan fans as there is no content but elevating characters of both lead actors. Since fans of these two lead actors are just caste based, director has to spend showing equal powerful roles both actors. Producer and director tried to make quick money with multi star movie with the success of previous movies. Don't waste money.",5/10,positive
SalmanMosvi,"I think this movie is hurry, three stories connected each other so quick. Thats I watched it twice. Jr NTR and Ram Charan play amazing as well as Ajay Devgan is last part is good but as like angry singham.This movie is in back time east India company start to take over subcontinent.Some people comparing it with success of PK Movie of Amir Khan which is good but PK is not like action movie it is reality of Subcontinent and religious warfare between Hindus and Muslims.At end this movie is full of entertainment I like it but not like KGF and Bahubali.",5/10,positive
viru_mo,Go to theatres leaving your brains at home. Only positive in the movie was cinematography. I have lost my faith on Rajamouli. Could have done better. Music is ok. Action scenes hard to digest but somehow saved the movie.,5/10,positive
hardikgpatel,"The film had set a very high bar as it is a Rajamouli project. But the film completely fails to deliver. I have never been a huge fan of action sequences in South Indian films, and the action sequences in RRR are no better than typical South movies. The action sequences in the climax, in particular, are so disgusting and illogical that they are almost unwatchable.The storyline of the film is equally pathetic. There is no strong ground established for Jenny's support of Bheem. Bheem's coincidental meeting with Sita is equally silly. Even the simplest story is riddled with many plot holes.There are many noticeable goofs, which should not be expected from a project of this scale. Overall, RRR is a big disaster!!",1/10,negative

Lucky_kc,"Happy to watch this movie. It is an emotional ride with brilliant actors. I loved NTR sirs performance. Do not compare this movie with any other, as every movie has its own individuality.Many people questioning that why any other history hero has not been considered for this, I have simple answer.It is a fictional story around two historical heroes. I recommend people to support this or to be silent and not to criticise the movie based on the characters.Criticizing a movie should be based on directors and cast performance but not based on genre you love or to would to see on the screen.",,positive
smaloney-39749,"I know nothing of this director or this film. I know nothing of the so-called Bollywood film industry or of the many films I assume that have come from there. So it's with this complete lack of appreciation that I decided to watch this movie after ready some positive reviews about it. In hindsight, I'm glad I did but I realize that you must suspend all belief about what makes sense in life or in movies and just accept what you're seeing, not judging. Just follow the story. There will be time to assess what you experienced once its over. And that's where I'm at now.The film is schlocky, jerky, fast pace and entertaining all at once. It probably is too long - - there are definite slow spots throughout, and there is gratuitous violence to the point it almost seems comical, (well it actually is comical in many scenes now that I think about it), and I guess that's the point on some level. In the end, this isn't a story that carries a strong message of morality, (after all one of the key goals achieved here is to return home with enough guns to kill all the British who have taken over their country.), No, this is just a good old fashion blood bath.",,positive
Darwinskid,"""RRR"" is an epic that offers its viewer just about everything they could want in a blockbuster - it has heart, it has action, it has drama, it has comedy, it has music, it has dance, and it even has romance. Many genre elements are placed within its lengthy narrative but done so well none feel out of place. The film oozes in rich style that never loses its freshness whenever it's applied scene-by-scene; the marriage between acting talent choreography and cinematography is just perfect, creating dynamic impact. It is such a lively picture that there is never a dull moment, and its exaggeration never hinders its emotional story beats.Hollywood should be taking note of films like ""RRR"", because if the current studio system tried something similar it simply would not deliver the same effect.",,positive
